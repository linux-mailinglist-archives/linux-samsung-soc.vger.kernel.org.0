Krzysztof, Henrik, thank you for the reply.

First of all thanks to everyone who is working on adding support for older =
devices to the linux kernel and alternative OS (such as Lineageos and Postm=
arketos).

As an outside observer I see a lot of work has been done over the last 4 ye=
ars to add support for Exynos9* based SoCs to the kernel. I understand that=
 my question is rather directed to Samsung and I was wondering if it is pos=
sible that all Exynos9* based SoCs will get at least basic support in mains=
tream anytime soon. If the answer is no, as a potential consumer I would li=
ke to know if Samsung is going to adopt Qualcomm's practices in mainstremin=
g code for at least its newer SoCs?

From a hardware point of view Samsung devices are amazing and very robust. =
I can tell the old flagship models are still popular especially among the e=
lderly users. But from a software point of view it is not safe to continue =
using my Galaxy anymore. It makes me sad and a little angry but I think its=
 time to put this smartphone in the drawer and move on.
