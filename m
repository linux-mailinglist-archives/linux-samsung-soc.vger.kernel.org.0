I see.

I've tried and printed some dbg in that driver and just simply
dropped the deeper idle and system runs. Idle driver account properly
the residency time for this WFI in the state0 dir. That's enough for
what I need in testing - accounting wfi from that dir location.

OK, good to know, I just found this driver by compatibility string and
thought it could be used.

Thank you Krzysztof for you instant response.
