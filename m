I'm not sure you've thought the above points through. :)

How is that any of this different to Mainline?

So long as you have the headers for the kernel you wish to compile
against, you can create all the new modules you like in both cases.

But no incentive to upstream code old (dead) platforms that they no
longer make money from.  We're not talking about kind-hearted
individuals here.  These are business entities.

What is the business incentive to put hundreds of thousands of dollars
into something with no RoI?

Again, you're being specific.  We would also like/need to make the
same kinds of changes to other vendor configurations.  One's which do
contribute significantly at their own cost.

The technical reasoning cannot be different because you do or don't
like the way the company operates.  Try to detach a little from
your feelings during discussions which should be purely technical.
