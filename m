That's what has to be figured out. Maybe there's a generic 
rule/transformation or maybe it's platform specifc or both?

Yes.

Yes, on the final value, but that leaves the base and overlay with 
invalid values.

Maybe we do something like '"", "soc"' and '"board", ""' so the entry is 
present even if the value is not. We still have to put something in the 
schema, but at least it makes it clear these are incomplete values.

The soc@0 node doesn't cover everything in the SoC though. The biggest 
thing being the CPU nodes.

That's empty for me...

But there are certainly .dtsi files which define a compatible that's 
invalid, but they are overwritten by the board .dts file.

We already do that with overlays. They are are not validated on their 
own, and that's why we require them to be applied at build time to 
something. Though that's hard to enforce and I'm not happy with 
extending that to the base.

As an aside, part of what makes validation so slow is N boards 
for an SoC validates the SoC part of the DT N times. I'd like a way to 
have a quicker validate all the SoC DTs.

I know you don't care. I just don't want a mixture here. And if anyone 
wants this to be an ABI, then the pieces need to be validated. Maybe 
everyone is tired of us beating the ABI drum and will be happy if it is 
not.

Okay, fair enough. I would drop anything you aren't certain you 
need. You can always add it later. It's also only really useful if you 
have DTs with the values *and* you run validation on them. If you do, 
great! If you don't, then upstream is just carrying dead code.

But others are and I need to worry about both. Conceivably, someone 
might want to do both. First combine the SoC and SoM DTs, and then 
combine that with the full board DT.

That would be more the connector usecase.

It's more how do you know if a base DT is a valid target for an overlay 
DT. I guess that's an orthongonal issue. You only have one base in your 
series, but in general how do you know what base to apply the overlays 
to? You've encoded that into the Makefile. The overlay-compatible scheme 
moves that information into the overlay so any s/w can figure that out. 

I think it would help if you described what you want to do more 
generically rather than mixed in with "add a new SoC" and send that to 
devicetree-spec and perhaps boot-architecture lists. Present the 
problem, not just the solution.
