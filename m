Oh fully agreeing with you here, I just wanted to lay out that a)
there is a solid plan to fix it and b) it's way too much work for me
to just type it as a part of a "learn me some core mm semantics"
project :-)

I was hoping that we could get away with a special marker for
problematic vma, and filter those out. But after all the digging I've
noticed that on anything remotely modern, there's just nothing left.
Device memory management has become massively more dynamic in the past
10 years.
