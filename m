Hi Arnd,

No, it does not create a bisection problem. The driver change adding new
compatible is already in v5.11-rc1.

It does not matter since it's a new compatible and old one is not
affected. Nothing got broken before this patch, nothing got broken after
applying it via samsung-soc. No backwards compatibility is affected.

It's a different hardware. New hardware does not have to be compatible
with old hardware. However old DTB is still doing fine (although with
the original issue not fixed).
