We have one problem with getting bus format from previous bridge if we
pass NULL in bridge_func.attach()
https://github.com/mszyprow/linux/commit/0fa57e33b3bf866efc4c17ab20eec28d6e07b3e9#diff-3fe873f1ada5f1dfcf2a50ac114bdab3ea7b026d12278648ca40809d3fa1a331R1321

Booting the video as it assigns default bus format if the previous bus
format is unknown.

[    1.635984] samsung-dsim 32e10000.dsi:
[drm:samsung_dsim_host_attach] Attached sn65dsi83 device
[    1.648067] [drm] Initialized mxsfb-drm 1.0.0 20160824 for
32e00000.lcdif on minor 0
[    1.658726] mmc0: SDHCI controller on 30b40000.mmc [30b40000.mmc]
using ADMA
[    1.681893] sn65dsi83 3-002c: Unsupported LVDS bus format 0x100a,
please check output bridge driver. Falling back to SPWG24.

Does passing the bridge to drm_bridge_attach is working on your platform?
return drm_bridge_attach(bridge->encoder, dsi->out_bridge, bridge, flags);

Thanks,
Jagan.
