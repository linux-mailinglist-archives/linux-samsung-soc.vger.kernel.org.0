I am still experimenting with the IRQ mode in DMC, but have limited time
for it and no TRM.
The IRQ mode in memory controller or bus controller has one major
advantage: is more interactive. In polling we have fixed period, i.e.
100ms - that's a lot when we have a sudden, latency sensitive workload.
There might be no check of the device load for i.e. 99ms, but the tasks
with such workload started running. That's a long period of a few frames
which are likely to be junked. Should we adjust polling interval to i.e.
10ms, I don't think so. There is no easy way to address all of the
scenarios.

As described above: more reactive to sudden workload, which might be
latency sensitive and cause junk frames.
Drawback: not best in benchmarks which are randomly jumping
over the data set, causing low traffic on memory.
It could be mitigated as Sylwester described with not only one type
of interrupt, but another, which could 'observe' also other information
type in the counters and fire.

System like Android with GUI, when there is this sudden workload
quite often.

I think the interconnect could help here and would adjust the DMC
freq upfront. Although I don't know if interconnect on Exynos5422 is in
your scope in near future. Of course the interconnect will not cover
all scenarios either.

The current interrupt mode is definitely not perfect and switching
to devfreq monitoring mode has more sense. On the other hand, it
still has potential, until there is no interconnect for this SoC.
I will continue experimenting with irq mode, so I would like to
still have the code in the driver.

Lukasz
