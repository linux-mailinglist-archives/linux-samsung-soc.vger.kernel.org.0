Agree, I should have not put 'this patch set' in the commit
msg. It should go into the cover letter and avoid this confusion.
You are right with ' Unless multi-core scheduler affects it...',
that's why when the SCHED_MC is missing, the decisions about task
placing might cause this variation and delay '13.0 - 12.2' seconds.

Good point, and I agree that it would require more investigation, for
which unfortunately I don't have currently spare cycles.

Should I merge patch 1/3 and 3/3 and send the v2 with a cover letter
which would have the test results?
