I had issues with devfreq governor which wasn't called by devfreq
workqueue. The old DELAYED vs DEFERRED work discussions and my patches
for it [1]. If the CPU which scheduled the next work went idle, the
devfreq workqueue will not be kicked and devfreq governor won't check
DMC status and will not decide to decrease the frequency based on low
busy_time.
The same applies for going up with the frequency. They both are
done by the governor but the workqueue must be scheduled periodically.

I couldn't do much with this back then. I have given the example that
this is causing issues with the DMC [2]. There is also a description
of your situation staying at 633MHz for long time:
' When it is missing opportunity
to change the frequency, it can either harm the performance or power
consumption, depending of the frequency the device stuck on.'

The patches were not accepted because it will cause CPU wake-up from
idle, which increases the energy consumption. I know that there were
some other attempts, but I don't know the status.

I had also this devfreq workqueue issue when I have been working on
thermal cooling for devfreq. The device status was not updated, because
the devfreq workqueue didn't check the device [3].

Let me investigate if that is the case.

Lukasz
