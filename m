To me it all feels like you pick up individual registers from the
common, miscellaneous register region aka syscon.

And if that's the case then you create a narrowly constrained binding
which won't work with next generations where hardware engineers decide
to make that shared region a bigger syscon.

0xc450014 looks like that. 0x0c637000, depends how other devices really
use it.

You should post somewhere full DTS for clarity. It's not a requirement
but it actually can answer several questions.

You describe the device in your SoC. This SoC either has both or has
not. The case of "can operate in USB2-only mode" is simply not real.

Yes, binding should describe complete hardware picture, so with USB3 and
all wires/signals being required.

If you have two bus clocks I think you have two separate devices...

But okay, if that's the case naming is fine.
