Makes sense, thanks!

If I manage to get ModelGauge working on this device in the future I
can address this.

Actually, it seems that the registers are set to the default Power-On
Reset (POR) values in both mainline and vendor kernel.  Printing all
the Cell Characterization Information Registers (given in Table 1 in
the MAX17047 datasheet) with something like:

    u32 tmp;
    regmap_read(chip->regmap, MAX17042_FullCAP, &tmp);
    dev_err(&chip->client->dev, "Fullcap %04x\n", tmp);

in both vendor kernel and mainline gives the same values:

    Fullcap    07d0
    DesignCap  07d0
    ICHGTerm   03c0
    FullCapNom 0667
    RCOMP0     0065
    Iavg_empty 0780
    TempCo     0930
    QRes 00    1e2f
    QRes 10    1e00
    QRes 20    1306
    QRes 30    0c00

and these are the POR values (seen in Table 5 of the datasheet).  Only
difference between vendor and mainline is that MAX17042_MODELChrTbl is
all zeros on mainline, while with vendor kernel I get something like:

    00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 
    00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 
    00 50 05 c0 a0 85 a9 f1 e0 5d 84 f1 01 00 00 00

and the values here change over time as well, as the algorithm learns
about the battery(?).

Maybe this means that the ModelGauge algorithm is not configured with
vendor kernel either, and that a full battery characterization
(described in [1]) is needed if we are to use ModelGauge.  ModelGauge
is also not mentioned in the vendor kernel driver for max17047 [2],
but it is mentioned in the very similar max17042 [3] and max17050
drivers in the same kernel.
