I can help, few other folks from Samsung can help as well.

Sure, I understand. Balance, compromise, not perfectness.

However now it is heavily in-balanced since vendor did upstream only one
change - UFS drivers for new SoC - since 2017. One change. Nothing else,
nothing for older SoC, nothing for newer.

All other work is done by the community, not by the vendor.

Not sure how to qualify Sam's Exynos850 work, but even if counting it,
there will be just two changes from vendor.

This is not acceptable, this is not a balanced approach.

Actually SERIAL_SAMSUNG does not have to be built-in. It is necessary
for built-in only for debugging or development, not for real products.

Unlike other drivers which have to be built-in, e.g. clocks or pinctrl,
or heavily tested whether setup from initrd works. Plus not breaking
distros who like to have everything as module (solution from Geert?)...

I am sorry, but this is not reflecting status we want to have in
usptream. Everything selected by ARCH_EXYNOS *has to be selected* for
supported platforms. Since vendor does not contribute anything new
(except mentioned one work for UFS), we are not going to sacrifice
supported mainline platforms for a non-cooperative out-of-tree unknown
platforms.

Not entirely. What actually would make everyone happy and it is still
technically feasible is for a multi-billion company with thousands of
engineers to contribute something. Let's start with a little bit. From
billions of dollars and thousands of engineers we won't expect too much,
right?


Best regards,
Krzysztof
