No, please first read our discussions, including Lee's and Geert's
comments. The drivers should not be converted to modules or made visible
if such configuration does not work. If it works, please describe your
testing setup.

All these drivers are *necessary* for a multiplatform kernel supporting
Exynos platforms, therefore disabling them does not make any sense (if
you support Exynos platform). If your kernel does not support Exynos
platform, just do not select ARCH_EXYNOS and problem disappears because
none of these drivers will be visible and selected.

Unless you describe here some out-of-tree kernel which wants
ARCH_EXYNOS, because vendor did not upstream it's code, but you do not
want existing Exynos upstream drivers. We do not support such
configuration. Please push your lovely vendor to work with upstream.
That's the only solution.

It's the third time this abuse re-usage of ARCH_EXYNOS appears and the
same as before - the vendor does not like to upstream stuff. There are
few guys trying to upstream recent Samsung SoC support by themself (ping
me for contacts if you would like to participate) but the one party
which should be doing it - the lovely vendor - does not actually
participate and instead sends ridiculous patches like this one here...
or like this [1] [2].

Nope, please work with upstreaming SoC support, instead of abusing
ARCH_EXYNOS for out of tree code from the vendor.
