Hi Krzysztof,

I am sorry, I was a bit busy recently.

The lock from devfreq lock protects from a scenario when
concurrent access from devfreq framework uses internal dmc fields 'load' 
and 'total' (which are set to 'busy_time', 'total_time').
The .get_dev_status can be called at any time (even due to thermal
devfreq cooling action) and reads above fields.
That's why the calculation of the new values inside dmc is protected.

This patch should not be taken IMO. Maybe we can release lock before the
if statement, just to speed-up.

Regards,
Lukasz
