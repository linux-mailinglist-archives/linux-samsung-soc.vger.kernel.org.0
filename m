In the long term it is better for entire kernel and SoC to support
deferred probes and register clocks as devices, not as CLK_OF_DECLARE. I
understand that it's not possible now to get rid of CLK_OF_DECLARE
entirely, but we could meet half-way.

The Exynos5433 has the same problem and it registers few core CMUs
early: the TOP, CPUs, memory bus, peripheral buses including PERIS with
MCT. I prefer this approach than yours. The only domains needing
CLK_OF_DECLARE are TOP and PERIS. Maybe also CORE - one would have to
check if GIC and CCI are needed early.
