I would be happy to submit it, but the original patch has no description in the commit message. Not being a coding developer myself I cannot explain whether it is correct or what it’s doing to add one. All I can do is confirm that it works, and is needed. SD card boot is not an issue.

Thanks for testing and performance measurements. The read speed seems to
be a direct effect of lower mmc bus frequency (DIVRATIO changed from 2
to 3).

What next? Except what Marek suggested, maybe compare MMC card
capabilities and try to find a difference? For example Marek's eMMC (at
least one with logs) is from Sandisk SDW16G. Christian's and Marian's
(Memeka / mihailescu2m) is apparently Samsung's 8GME4R.

Because the patch reduces performance and not all users are affected, I
have some doubts. Maybe use by default lower clock (so as in this patch)
but if card is in list of known good cards go higher?

Another idea is to use always slower bus because it is simply safer and
we do not have resources to test 100x of different eMMC modules...

Any comments from you?

Best regards,
Krzysztof
