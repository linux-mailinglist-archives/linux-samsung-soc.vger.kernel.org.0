The changes I propose won't prevent anything from asking for more
power/energy (will always allow turning on stuff, increasing voltage,
increasing current, etc). It'll only prevent reducing power lower than
what was provided when the bootloader left stuff on. This shouldn't
break most boards -- because any other consumer could be setting
similar limits and things don't break then. But even if that's a
concern, we can still default to a timeout behavior and then give
folks the choice of disabling the timeout if they know all their
devices will probe.

Btw, the patch series I sent fixes a lot of subtle use cases even with
the timeout enabled. For example, in one hardware platform, a LDO is
shared between camera, display, UFS and USB. The camera driver would
probe first, enable the regulator, poll its HW and then disable the
regulator. This causes the regulator to be disabled before display,
UFS, and USB could probe and this caused hardware faults for those.

Ah, finally! I have examples of pretty much the same issue in some
downstream kernels -- the CPU and memory shares rails with other
hardware blocks and things fail if this isn't taken care of. Glad that
someone else found an example for me in the upstream kernel.

I'll send out a v3 series in a couple of days to address Mark's
earlier comments and also add the voltage support to address Marek's
case. We can take it from there.
