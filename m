It looks wrong then. Driver should not depend on DTS. I cannot find
the patch changing bindings (should be first in patchset) which could
also point to this problem.

It seems you added requirement for interconnect properties while it
should be rather optional.

It's okay then (for them to be split).

If you have in mind all the nodes with "status=3Dokay", it's fine to
duplicate them.
