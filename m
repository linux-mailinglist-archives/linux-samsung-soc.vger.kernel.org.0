yeah vfio is still broken for the case I care about. I think there's
also some questions open still about whether kvm really uses
mmu_notifier in all cases correctly, but iirc the one exception was
s390, which didn't have pci mmap and that's how it gets away with that
specific problem.

tbh I never really got the additional issue with the missing write
checks. That users of follow_pfn (or well follow_pte + immediate lock
dropping like vfio) don't subscribe to the pte updates in general is
the bug I'm seeing. That v4l also glosses over the read/write access
stuff is kinda just the icing on the cake :-) It's pretty well broken
even if it would check that.
