I am not saying about defconfigs. I am saying that ARMv8 platform is
multiplatform so we already solved the problem Will mentioned. :)

<grumpy mode>
Therefore the use case is to not contribute anything upstream around
ARCH_EXYNOS but use it in millions of devices downstream with hundreds
of out-of-tree modules. The use case is to make life easy for the vendor
and out-of-tree code, not for the upstream. Instead of promoting
upstreaming, or leaning towards usptream in some balanced way, the use
case is to entirely go to out-of-tree.

I am not thinking here about edge or not-yet-released platforms but
"ancient" in terms of current SoC business, e.g. 3-5 years old.

GKI encourages core kernel changes to be upstreamed but it is
effectively the nail in the coffin of upstreaming vendor SoC changes.
There is simply no incentive for less-cooperative vendor to upstream
it's modules (except usual benefits like code quality and user support
which are not important for less-cooperative vendors).

The kernel should be configured mainly towards mainline platforms. Not
the other way around. This of course does not stop it for supporting
out-of-tree code, but I guess you also know that what's out-of-tree, it
does not exist. :)

Thanks Lee, you described the use case. In general I like it and support
it, except for what I wrote in the other mail.

Vendor does not contribute much therefore there is no balance in
upstreaming. Since none of other vendor's platforms are supported, I am
looking only at what is supported. From that perspective - the change
proposed by Will and previous guys, does not have much sense.

My perspective probably would change a lot if vendor did contribute some
of its non-edge platforms (3-5 years old)... especially that unlike few
community guys (e.g. PostmarketOS), vendor has shit-tons of money and
the hardware manuals. :)

Instead of pushing this change, please let's give some incentive to the
vendor for upstreaming anything.

Best regards,
Krzysztof
