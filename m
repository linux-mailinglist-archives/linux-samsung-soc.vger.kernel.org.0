Note that vb2_vmalloc is only used for in-kernel CPU usage, e.g. the
contents being copied by the driver between vb2 buffers and some
hardware FIFO or other dedicated buffers. The memory does not go to
any hardware DMA.

Could you elaborate on what "the REQUIRED behavior is"? I can see that
both follow the get_vaddr_frames() -> frame_vector_to_pages() flow, as
you mentioned. Perhaps the only change needed is switching to
pin_user_pages after all?

That's not the case. There are two usage scenarios:

1) Regular user pointer support, i.e. using malloc()ed memory as a
video input or output buffer. This is deemed to be deprecated, but
still used quite widely by various applications. Quite common for
video decoder input and video encoder output, because the other side
of the pipeline is CPU, e.g. network stack.

2) Sharing carveout buffers (without struct pages attached) between
two devices. I believe this predates DMA-buf and CMA (which enabled
carveouts with struct pages) and I'm not sure how commonly it is used
these days.

See above.
