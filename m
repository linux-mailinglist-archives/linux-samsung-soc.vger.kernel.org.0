The 7-10 depend on 1-6 from this set. 1-6 are in the tag provided by
Mark, so you have to base your work on Mark's tag.

Then you will get everything from this patchset (but v4, not v3 please).
The patchset itself does not depend on anything else, so I do not expect
Rob objecting. It was also reviewed by Rob.

To summarize: please merge tag from Mark and apply patches 7-10 from v4
on top of that tag.


Best regards,
Krzysztof
