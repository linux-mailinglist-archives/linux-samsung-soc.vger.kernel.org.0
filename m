With a dummy regulator regulator_set_current_limit() fails with -EINVAL.
Isn't it better to just skip charging control (and dev_info()) when there=
=20
is no extcon or regulator? The charger driver would still probe
without those 2 properties and work as before.

Adding disabled nodes for Origen would probably still makes sense.

I also noticed that adding nodes for those MFD cells prints "DMA mask
not set" which seems to be related to https://lkml.org/lkml/2020/4/23/873.
Any suggestions on how to handle that?

Thanks,
