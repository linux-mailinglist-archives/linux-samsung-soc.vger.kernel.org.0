Hi,

Yeah, it was because of the dang defconfig patches. My general policy
is to send the cover letter to everyone even if not everyone gets CCed
on all patches, but it ended up as a lot... Speaking of which, I'd
definitely be interested in your take on the defconfig topic:

https://lore.kernel.org/r/CAD=FV=WPXAUyuAHb1jKx9F_aw+JGX4MWB3or=Eq5rXoKY=OQMw@mail.gmail.com

Do you agree with Olof that I should set the "default" for the new
config to be the same as the old config? It doesn't make sense going
forward but it helps for anyone with old configs...

I have read several and (so far) they have been quite reliable but I
will admit that I haven't done an exhaustive sample. I guess my answer
to whether we can trust it is:

a) Presumably you'd only use this new "edp-panel" compatible on
systems whose panel IDs are known to be reliable. Old systems can keep
determining the panel by compatible string. The two schemes can
co-exist.

b) As we start using this new scheme then there will be more
validation of panel ID strings and, presumably, they will become more
reliable.

It is still true that ID conflicts could exist. A vendor could ship
two different panels with the same ID and maybe nobody would notice
because they weren't ever hooked up to the same board. In that case
we'd have a question of what to do upstream. If this really happens
then I suppose (worst case) we could use the device tree to help
differentiate and each board could say that "panel ID <x> hooked up to
this board is actually panel <y>". I hope we don't have to do that
because it feels dirty, but at least it gives us _something_ if we get
backed into a corner.

This could be another way to help us if we're backed into a corner in
the future. Right now the driver requires that you give access to a
full eDP AUX bus to use the "generic eDP" panel support even though it
currently only relies on the EDID, so it would be pretty easy to
utilize this info in the future. So far the ID has been reliable for
me though.
