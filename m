I admitted that my changelog needs fixes in my first reply.
"I should've called it out specifically in the change log. Sorry for the
inconvenience.".
Maybe you think I didn't read through because my reply was placed
before the <form letter> section, but that's a misunderstanding.
I did read through the paragraph, that's why I mentioned the
changelog in my first reply.

I also misunderstood your question of "Where did you address
this?". If you were asking where this should have been addressed,
obviously the answer is to address it in the changelog,
but I thought that was already made clear in the first reply and
you might be asking for a clear answer.

I appreciate you pointing out the specific paragraph, I understand
you're going above and beyond here. I did read and understand
what should've been done instead for this patch.

Thank you for the feedback. I understand your frustration, and I
apologize for taking up your time. I will be sure to be more thorough
in the future.

Thanks,
