 As I say, last time I checked (for another reason) documentation was not 
available to the general public, so I can't help with that.

 Whatever the exact transaction conditions are port I/O TLPs seem not to 
make it through to the requested target device anymore.

 FWIW the defxx driver issues a command to the device's command register 
and wants to see a successful completion status in the status register 
before retrieving the MAC address via the data register.  So it's not a 
simple case of poking at a register and reading it back, but the end 
result is the same: the device cannot be talked to.

 No worries, I've been around for long enough (short of 30 years) to know 
the process.

 FWIW the original change would've best been reverted for 6.18 as a fatal 
regression, however port I/O is uncommon enough nowadays we can defer any 
final decision to 6.19 I suppose.  I'm glad I've tripped over this in the 
first place as I'm not eager to upgrade all my lab devices all the time, 
and it was owing to another issue only that I chose this moment to move 
forward, not so long after the original commit.

 No change in behaviour, sorry.  I suppose it's this range of host address 
decoding:

fu740-pcie e00000000.pcie:       IO 0x0060080000..0x006008ffff -> 0x0060080000

aka:

pci_bus 0000:00: root bus resource [io  0x0000-0xffff] (bus address [0x60080000-0x6008ffff])

that you're after.  Are you sure your code discovers it correctly?  As I 
say I can only see IORESOURCE_MEM references and no IORESOURCE_IO ones as 
would be appropriate for the root bus resource quoted.
