I see this made it into the pull request now, but I had not been aware
of the change earlier, and I'm slightly annoyed to have received it this
way:

- This is clearly an incompatible change to the dtb, and you all
   noticed that because it would cause a bisection problem. As
   a general rule, if a dts change does not work across bisection,
   we should not merge it at all, because it causes problems for
   anyone with external dts or dtb files.

- It would likely have been possible to define the new binding in
  a backward-compatible way. I don't see a reason why the index
  values in the binding had to change here, other than a slight
  inconvenience for the driver.

- If the change was really unavoidable, I would have expected
  a long explanation about why it had to be done in both the
  commit message and in the tag description for the pull
  request.

I've dropped the pull request for now, maybe this can still
be sorted out with another driver change that makes the
new compatible string backward-compatible.
