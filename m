Add top-level DT bindings useful for Pixel 10 (frankel), Pixel 10 Pro
(blazer), and Pixel 10 Pro XL (mustang).

Since overlays are fairly well-supported these days and the downstream
Pixel bootloader assumes that the SoC is the base overlay and specific
board revisions are overlays, reflect the SoC / board split in the
bindings.

The SoC in the Pixel 10 series has the marketing name of "Tensor
G5". Despite the fact that it sounds very similar to the "Tensor G4",
it's a very different chip. Tensor G4 was, for all intents and
purposes, a Samsung Exynos offshoot whereas Tensor G5 is entirely its
own SoC. This SoC is known internally as "laguna" and canonically
referred to in code as "lga". There are two known revisions of the
SoC: an A0 pre-production variant (ID 0x000500) and a B0 variant (ID
0x000510) used in production. The ID is canonicaly broken up into a
16-bit SoC product ID, a 4-bit major rev, and a 4-bit minor rev.

The dtb for all supported SoC revisions is appended to one of the boot
partitions and the bootloader will look at the device trees and pick
the correct one. The current bootloader uses a downstream
`soc_compatible` node to help it pick the correct device tree. It
looks like this:
  soc_compatible {
    B0 {
      description = "LGA B0";
      product_id = <0x5>;
      major = <0x1>;
      minor = <0x0>;
      pkg_mode = <0x0>;
    };
  };
Note that `pkg_mode` isn't currently part of the ID on the SoC and the
bootloader always assumes 0 for it.

In this patch, put the SoC IDs straight into the compatible. Though
the bootloader doesn't look at the compatible at the moment, this
should be easy to teach the bootloader about.

Boards all know their own platform_id / product_id / stage / major /
minor / variant. For instance, Google Pixel 10 Pro XL MP1 is:
* platform_id (8-bits): 0x07 - frankel/blazer/mustang
* product_id (8-bits):  0x05 - mustang
* stage (4-bits):       0x06 - MP
* major (8-bits):       0x01 - MP 1
* minor (8-bits):       0x00 - MP 1.0
* variant (8-bits):     0x00 - No special variant

When board overlays are packed into the "dtbo" partition, a tool
(`mkdtimg`) extracts a board ID and board rev from the overlay and
stores that as metadata with the overlay. Downstream, the dtso
intended for the Pixel 10 Pro XL MP1 has the following properties at
its top-level:
  board_id = <0x70506>;
  board_rev = <0x010000>;

The use of top-level IDs can probably be used for overlays upstream as
well, but also add the IDs to the compatible string in case it's
useful.

Compatible strings are added for all board revisions known to be
produced based on downstream sources.

A few notes:
* If you look at `/proc/device-tree/compatible` and
  `/proc/device-tree/model` on a running device, that won't
  necessarily be an exact description of the hardware you're running
  on. If the bootloader can't find a device tree that's an exact match
  then it will pick the best match (within reason--it will never pick
  a device tree for a different product--just for different revs of
  the same product).
* There is no merging of the top-level compatible from the SoC and
  board. The compatible string containing IDs for the SoC will not be
  found in the device-tree passed to the OS.

In the past, attempts to have the SoC as a base device tree and boards
supported as overlays has been NAKed. From a previous discussion [1]
"Nope, boards are not overlays. Boards are DTB." I believe this needs
to be relitigated.

In the previous NAK, I didn't see any links to documentation
explicitly stating that DTBs have to represent boards. It's also
unclear, at least to me, _why_ a DTB would be limited to represent a
"board" nor what the definition of a "board" is.

As at least one stab at why someone might not want an overlay scheme
like this, one could point out that the top-level compatible can be a
bit of a mess. Specifically in this scheme the board "compatible" from
the overlay will fully replace/hide the SoC "compatible" from the base
SoC. If this is truly the main concern, it wouldn't be terribly hard
to add a new semantic (maybe selectable via a new additional
property?) that caused the compatible strings to be merged in a
reasonable way.

Aside from dealing with the compatible string, let's think about what
a "board" is. I will make the argument here that the SoC qualifies as
a "board" and that the main PCB of a phone can be looked at as a
"cape" for this SoC "board". While this may sound like a stretch, I
would invite a reader to propose a definition of "board" that excludes
this. Specifically, it can be noted:
* I have a development board at my desk that is "socketed". That is, I
  can pull the SoC out and put a different one in. I can swap in a
  "rev A0" or a "rev B0" SoC into this socket. Conceivably, I could
  even put a "Tensor G6", G7, G8, or G999 in the socket if it was
  compatible. In this sense, the "SoC" is a standalone thing that can
  be attached to the devboard "cape". The SoC being a standalone thing
  is in the name. It's a "system" on a chip.
* In case the definition of a board somehow needs a PCB involved, I
  can note that on my dev board the CPU socket is soldered onto to a
  CPU daughtercard (a PCB!) that then has a board-to-board connector
  to the main PCB.
* Perhaps one could argue that a dev board like I have describe would
  qualify for this SoC/board overlay scheme but that a normal cell
  phone wouldn't because the SoC isn't removable. Perhaps removability
  is a requirement here? If so, imagine if some company took a
  Raspberry Pi, soldered some components directly onto the "expansion"
  pins, and resold that to consumers. Does this mean they can't use
  overlays?

To me, the above arguments justify why SoC DTBs + "board" overlays
should be accepted. As far as I can tell, there is no downside and
many people who would be made happy with this.
