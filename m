Then how about TSP_LDO1, TSP_LDO2, TSP_LDO3?

The LDO23 is most likely for the touch panel ADC, not for the SoC one.
Here it could be LDO3. You have to put something otherwise dtschema will
complain.

Go with the LDO3 and maybe a comment like: "TBD, not confirmed".

Actually, let's skip the constraints (min-max) for unknown regulators.
Just add the entries with generic names, like:
arch/arm/boot/dts/exynos5410-odroidxu.dts

I would not put here min-max constraints from bootloader because pretty
often it has only an initial setup for specific frequency - just to make
it booting.

If you have the constraints (min-max, always on) from vendor sources,
you could add them.

Best regards,
Krzysztof
