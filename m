The order of patches should reflect first of all real dependency.
Whether it compiles, works at all and does not break anything.  Logical
dependency of "when the feature will start working" is
irrelevant to DTS because DTS goes in separate way and driver is
independent of it.

I am sorry but it brings only confusion. DTS is orthogonal of the
driver code. You could even post the patchset without DTS (although then
it would raise questions where is the user of it, but still, you
could).

Further, DTS describes also hardware so you could send certain DTS
patches without driver implementation to describe the hardware.

Driver code and DTS are kind of different worlds so mixing them up for
logical review does not really make any sense.

Not mentioning it is different than most of other patches on mailing
lists.

BTW, it is the same as bindings which should (almost) always go first as
separate patches.

I see. That property also does not look like board (Odroid) specific so
it should be moved to Exynos4412 DTSI.
