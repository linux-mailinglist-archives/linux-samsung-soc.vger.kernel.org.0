I am trying to add support in mainline for a tablet based on Exynos
5420 (Samsung Galaxy Tab S).  For this tablet, CCI has to be disabled,
and with that the device then hangs during

  exynos_smc(SMC_CMD_CPU1BOOT, cpu, 0, 0),

which is run in the cpu_boot secure-firmware function.  If the call is
skipped, then four out of eight CPUs are brought up, which is the same
as on exynos5420-arndale-octa [1] which also has disabled CCI.

Based on Samsung's kernel sources, it seems like the SMC_CMD_CPU1BOOT
call is only needed on Exynos4 and Exynos5250 devices [2], on other
SoC models the call is skipped.  To test if the call seem to do
anything, I booted exynos5422-odroid-xu4 with disabled CCI and with or
without the SMC_CMD_CPU1BOOT call.  The result in both cases were the
same: the first four CPUs were brought up.

To further investigate if the SMC_CMD_CPU1BOOT call is handled we need
to dig into the trustzone firmware.  The trustzone firmware used in
exynos5410-odroid-xu has been to a large part reverse engineered [3],
and by comparing with sboot/tzsw in mainline devices it can be seen
that similar trustzone firmware is used in several.  Out of those, the
SMC_CMD_CPU1BOOT call seem to be only handled in Exynos4 devices.

Here's a table summarising the findings for the mainline devices that
have a secure-firmware node (Exynos3 devices omitted).  An extra 4212
device has been included to get a datapoint for that SoC as well.

"Similar tzsw" above means that the secure monitor calls seem to be
handled in the same way as for exynos5410-odroid-xu, in a quite
easy-to-spot function (see patch for what it looks like).

For the tablet I am actually interested in, the trustzone firmware
looks very different, and I have not been able to locate where/how the
secure monitor calls are handled.

Nevertheless, since the call seem to only be handled in trustzone
firmware for Exynos4, and since exynos5422-odroid-xu4 behaves the same
with or without this secure monitor call, I *think* it should be safe
to only run it on the devices where we know that it is handled.
