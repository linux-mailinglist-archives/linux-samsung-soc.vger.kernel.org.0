It shouldn't harm the EAS but it might be used by thermal, especially
those OPPs from the top. Like in your case in step_wise (IIRC the DT
settings).
But removing some of these from the bottom, would be good.
It would lower the Energy Model complexity, which is:
nr_perf_domain * (nr_cpus + nr_OPPs) [1] (in Odroid XU4 is ~80 IIRC)

smaller OPP number is better.

Douglas is working on a patch set which could skip non-efficient OPPs
(the OPPs which have the same voltage but different frequency).
Although, we don't know the numbers how much it could save energy - when
we use the fastest frequency for the set of OPPs with the same voltage,
comparing to the slowest (theoretically entering idle earlier) .
The discussion is ongoing here [2].

Regarding the print message. It's not a bug in the platform so in
my opinion we shouldn't use 'pr_warn' in this case.
It's going to be changed to just debug level print. I have this
change in the new Energy Model. It is in last point in changelog v3 [3]
and the change which does this is in patch 1/4:
--------------------------------------------->8------------------
-			pr_warn("pd%d: hertz/watts ratio non-monotonically decreasing: 
em_cap_state %d >= em_cap_state%d\n",
-					cpu, i, i - 1);
+			dev_dbg(dev, "EM: hertz/watts ratio non-monotonically decreasing: 
em_perf_state %d >= em_perf_state%d\n",
+					i, i - 1);

--------------------------------------8<------------------------
