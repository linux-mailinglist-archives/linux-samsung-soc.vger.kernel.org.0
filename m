I can plug my lga SoC into my dev board too. My dev board literally
has a place for me to drop in the SoC. I unscrew the socket connector,
carefully make sure that none of the balls of the SoC have dust
particles on them (and we have instructions for cleaning the SoC),
then drop the SoC into the socket (ideally using a vacuum pen tool). I
then screw the top back together which uses compression to attach the
balls on the SoC.

Yes, this is only true on dev boards and not phones, but we want to be
able to support dev boards too and it would be silly to have a
different split between DTB and overlays for dev boards and phones
that are based on the same architecture.

As per above, sockets do exist. They are pluggable. I have confidence
that even with clumsy fingers you could drop the SoC into the slot and
screw the connector down.

I'm still not totally convinced that it should require the existence
of a socket to justify this but, yes, they do exist.

My logic (stated later in my email) is that the minimum requirement
for a compatible should be something with a CPU able to execute
instructions. A single transistor can't do that. If you want to
combine a bunch of transistors together to make a CPU then absolutely
you should be able to have a DTB representing this CPU.

A "SoC" is "complete". It has a processor that can run instructions.

I still don't understand why a SoC doesn't qualify for your
definition. Even if it did, there is _no benefit_ from excluding a SoC
from this definition. I'm trying to figure out what the benefit is for
holding to this stance.

In any case, maybe we can approach this a different way that I alluded
to in one of my other posts. Can we just call the SoC thing something
different and make everyone happy?

1. Rename the SoC file to lga-b0.dtf (device tree fragment) and
_REMOVE_ the top-level compatible. Problem solved--we're not adding a
top-level compatible.

2. Add a special node at the top level of the "dtf" file describing it
(so someone could figure it's useful for). Like:

fragment-info {
  compatible =3D "google,soc-id";
  google,product-id =3D <0x5>;
  google,major-rev =3D <0x1>;
  google,minor-rev =3D <0x0>;
  google,package-mode =3D <0x0>;
};

3. We can compile the "dtf" file using existing tools into a "dtfb".
This looks just like a "dtb" but has no top-level compatible but
instead has "fragment-info".

Now we're not violating any spec because we're not adding any
top-level compatible.
