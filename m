Even if we drop this 'non-standard' behaviour, your task will be still 
quite difficult to fulfil - you are trying to completely rewrite core 
component of Exynos display pipeline without hardware to test.

ExynosDSI is used in almost all Exynos platforms supported mainline (ls 
-1 arch/arm*/boot/dts/exynos*.dts | wc shows 35). It has different hw 
versions (4 compatibles) and is used in different configurations (video 
mode, command mode, with hw/sw trigger, connected to panels/bridges) and 
for sure with big heritage, since it was one of the 1st DSI drivers.

Rewriting such driver is challenging, even with access to hw.

So maybe it would be better to move common parts in your and exynos 
driver to 'shared library' and use it in both drivers - this way you 
have bigger chances to avoid traps.
