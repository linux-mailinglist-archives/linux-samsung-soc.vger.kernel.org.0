Yes, you need either workqueue.power_efficient kernel param or CONFIG
option to actually enable it.  But at least it could then work on any
CPU.

Another solution is to use directly WQ_UNBOUND.

This should not be a configurable option. Why someone would prefer to
use one over another and decide about this during build or run time?
Instead it should be just *right* all the time. Always.

Argument that we want to save power so we will not wake up any CPU is
ridiculous if because of this system stays in high-power mode.

If system is idle and memory going to be idle, someone should be woken
up to save more power and slow down memory controller.

If system is idle but memory going to be busy, the currently busy CPU
(which performs some memory-intensive job) could do the job and ramp up
the devfreq performance.

Best regards,
Krzysztof
