I agree with Marek. This can be done incrementally. The series fixes the
code path which was working. After the investigation with a power
meter, a proper set of new patches might come if needed.

As a hint to measure this power consumption difference, because it
might be tricky, I would suggest to heat up the SoC. The main
difference between wfi and deeper idle which cut the power
to some components (like caches) should be seen at higher voltage
OPP and higher temperature. It's due to the fact that static power
(leakage) is related to Vdd and temperature -
higher voltage -> higher leakage
higher temp -> higher leakage
This difference (idle state 0 vs 1) should be amplified in the
above scenario and easier to measure.

I am going to review this series after finishing hotplug tests.

Regards,
Lukasz
