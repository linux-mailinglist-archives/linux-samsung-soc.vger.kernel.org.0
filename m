Ack, I've just sent a patch to fix that:

  ARM: exynos: clear L310_AUX_CTRL_FULL_LINE_ZERO in default l2c_aux_val

Sorry about the confusion in my first patch, I got mislead with
the TRM of an earlier revision of the L2C-310 when these bits
were used to set the RAM data read latency.  So this all makes
sense to me now with the matching documentation for the hardware.

OK I'll take a look at that and send a separate patch.

Presumably this bit should also be added to the mask to report an
error if the kernel is changing it?

As far as I can tell, L310_AUX_CTRL_CACHE_REPLACE_RR is bit 25
i.e. 0x02000000, which is set in hardware by default and is not
changed by the kernel:

    L2C: platform modifies aux control register: 0x02070000 -> 0x3e470001

Also this bit is already in the mask, and there is no error about
register corruption any more with the patch I sent today.

Ack, it's handled by l2c310_of_parse().  I'll take a look and see
if I can make another patch for that.

Thanks,
Guillaume
