I have eMMC module attached to Odroid U3 (Exynos4412,
samsung,exynos4412-dw-mshc). What is the testing procedure? With your
patch it boots fine:
[    3.698637] mmc_host mmc1: Bus speed (slot 0) = 50000000Hz (slot
req 52000000Hz, actual 50000000HZ div = 0)
[    3.703900] mmc1: new DDR MMC card at address 0001
[    3.728458] mmcblk1: mmc1:0001 008G92 7.28 GiB

Best regards,
Krzysztof
