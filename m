Hm so Jason and me discussed this, but e.g. the s390 is safe with with
just the pagetable locks. So we'd need two versions.

The more practical problem is that I haven't found a reasonable way to
check that a passed in mmu_notifier is registered against the mm we're
working on, and without that check it feels a bit silly. But if you
see how to do that I think we can do an EXPORT_SYMBOL_GPL follow_pfn
which takes the notifier, and an __follow_pfn for s390 and similar
internal code which isn't exported.

Hm yeah that's another one. There's also some virt stuff that's
currently on unsafe_follow_pfn and needs to be switched over, and I
think that would also need an mmu notifier of some sorts to close the
gaps.
