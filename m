Like with everything in Linux kernel. We merge instead of duplicate.
It's not an argument.

There are several similarities which actually suggest that you
exaggerate the differences.

The number of interrupts is the same (4+8 in older one, 12 in new one...).
You assign the MCT priority also as higher than Architected Timer
(+Cc Will and Mark - is it ok for you?)
    evt->rating = 500;      /* use value higher than ARM arch timer *

All these point that block is not different. Again, let me repeat, we
support old Samsung PMICs with new Samsung PMICs in one driver. Even
though the "old one" won't be changed, as you mentioned here. The same
Samsung SoC clock drivers are used for old Exynos and for new ones...
Similarly to pinctrl drivers. The same ChipId.

Everywhere we follow the same concept of unification instead of
duplication. Maybe Exynos MCT timer is an exception but you did not
provide any arguments supporting this. Why Exynos MCTv2 should be
treated differently than Exynos850 clocks, chipid, pinctrl and other blocks?

Daniel,
Any preferences from you? Integrating MCT into existing driver (thus
growing it) or having a new one?

Best regards,
Krzysztof
