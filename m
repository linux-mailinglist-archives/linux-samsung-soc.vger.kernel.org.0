Clocks is an excellent example: if a clock is missing, the driver
will fail to probe (unless the clock is considered optional by
the driver), regardless of the power-on or boot loader defaults.
With fw_devlinks=on (which is the default now, and developed by a
Google engineer (GKI or another division?)), the driver won't even
get to the probing point.

Pinctrl is different, as unless I'm mistaken, drivers will still
probe if the pin control driver is missing, so they will work if the
power-on or boot loader defaults of pin control are fine.

The question is if Linux can actually boot on the affected platform
without this "additional cruft" builtin, for which we still haven't
received any confirmation yet...

So claiming to be "upstream first", and submitting patches, is great,
but only if the changes you're upstreaming actually work.
If they don't, and if you insist on keeping on upstreaming them,
without providing evidence that they don't break the affected platform
completely, perhaps this should be treated similar to the UMN patches?
