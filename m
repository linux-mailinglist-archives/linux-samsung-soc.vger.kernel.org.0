Are there any such systems in KernelCI? We caught a suspend/resume
related issue in development, which is why the hunk below was added.
In general, any virt-to-phys translation involving and address on the
stack will become problematic.

Could you please confirm whether the issue persists with the patch
applied but with CONFIG_VMAP_STACK turned off? Just so we know we are
looking in the right place?
