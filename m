Dear Friend.

I am General John F. Campbell; a male soldier working as United
Nations (UN) peace keeping troop in Afghanistan on war against
terrorism, I am the commanding officer of the third Battalion soldier
regime. As you may know, everyday there are several cases of insurgent
attacks and suicide bombs going on here in Afghanistan we are being
attacked everyday by Islamic rebels and during one of our rescue
mission we came across a treasure box that contain some big amount of
money that was hidden under ground house and we sized the box and
decide to share the money among us. The total amount is US$218 Million
dollars in cash, because we notice that the money was set to buy war
weapons for terrorist group to attack the Government of Afghanistan  /
United States Forces, which we shared the money among ourselves and I
got $14.8 million dollars as my own share of the fund, Now my mission
here in Afghanistan will soon expire for me to leave Afghanistan camp
and if I do not ship out the fund; I might end up losing the money,
because as army military officer all eyes is upon us watching in the
War zone, especially journalist there are against us and must problem
we are facing here, that it=E2=80=99s the most reason why we are not allowe=
d
to make any calls here for security reasons.

That it=E2=80=99s the reason why I deposited this money with a Red Cross ag=
ent
as Diplomatic courier service. Now I want you to stand as my
beneficiary and receive the fund and keep it safe so that as soon as
am through with my mission here in Afghanistan, which is a war zone
right now; then you will assist me to invest it in a good profitable
Venture or you keep it for me until I arrive your country, I will give
you 30% of the total money for your assistance after you have receive
the money while 10% will be kept aside should be in-case any expenses
occur during the process. Because I am not a Greedy man; my interest
is for you to receive the money first. Meanwhile you should keep my
portion 60% safety before my arrival, Please if you are not interested
to assist me with my condition of percentage to receive the fund don=E2=80=
=99t
waste my time because it=E2=80=99s an urgency, whereby you are ready and
willing to assist me receive the fund reply me back immediately so
that I can send you the information where the money is been deposited,
your urgent reply is needed.

Yours Truly Friend
GENERAL JOHN F. CAMPBELL.
