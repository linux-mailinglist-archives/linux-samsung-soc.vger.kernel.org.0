The message "L2C: platform provided aux values permit register
corruption." means that bits are set in both the mask and the value
fields.  Since the new value is calculated as:

	old = register value;
	new = old & mask;
	new |= val;

If bits are set in both "mask" and "val" for a multi-bit field, the
value ending up in the field may not be what is intended.  Consider
a 5-bit field set initially to 10101, and the requested value is
01000 with a mask of 11111.  What you end up with is not 01000, but
11101.  Hence, register corruption.  It is not possible to easily
tell whether the mask and values refer to a multi-bit field or not,
so the mere fact that bits are set in both issues the alert.

The message "L2C: platform modifies aux control register ..." means
that you're trying to modify the value of the auxiliary control
register, which brings with it the problems I stated in my previous
email; platform configuration of the L2C must be done by firmware and
not the kernel for the reasons I've set out.
