I missed the fact that there is usually a specific SFR sequence required
for disabling the CMU root (and APB) clock. We would need to figure out what
an exact sequence is for each CMU, similarly as is done in clk-exynos5433,
then keeping the CMU source clock always enabled shouldn't be required.
I'm fine with just enabling the APB clocks in probe() until proper CMU
suspend/resume support is added.

I think some of the clocks supplied by a CMU need to be in use
(e.g. clk_prepare()) to get the resume op in the CMU driver invoked.

Enabling the clock corresponds with the pm_runtime_set_active() call you
pointed out above. Such pattern also ensures the clock will stay enabled
when CONFIG_PM_RUNTIME is disabled.

It is not really a separate feature, I think having the clocks permanently
enabled is not something we would like to end up with. It would need to be
revisited anyway when adding the power domains support.

You need device pointer to get the CMU input clocks as specified in DT.
clk_get with NULL device pointer and global clock name will now only work
on Samsung non-DT platforms, for DT-only SoCs we don't register clkdev
entries at all (see samsung_clk_register_alias()).

Sounds good to me, thank you for working on this.
