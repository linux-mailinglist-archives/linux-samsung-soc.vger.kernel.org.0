Yes it has clocks property but used by SCMI(for CPUFreq/DevFreq) and not
by any clock provider driver. E.g. the issue you will see if "clocks"
property is used instead of "qcom,freq-domain" on Qcom parts.

On SCMI, we have used clocks property to represent perf domain which I
understand is not ideal but it is there üôÅ.
