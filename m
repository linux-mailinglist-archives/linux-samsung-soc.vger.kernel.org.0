But I think we are speaking about the other way around were you would be
e.g. removing properties or splitting a node is multiple different
nodes following a different understanding of the hardware.
And in this case, any rework of the bindings will be forbidden, like
32b7cfbd4bb2 ("ARM: dts: at91: remove deprecated ADC properties") will
break older kernels trying to use the new dtb.
761f6ed85417 ("ARM: dts: at91: sama5d4: use correct rtc compatible") is
an other case.
I'm not sure want to keep the older properties or the older compatible
string as a fallback for this use case.

Yes and I can't see any drawbacks in this approach.

My understanding was that the traditional PPC systems had a small device
tree and usually are not affected by driver changes but I may be wrong.

Aren't the ones using a distro kernel with a custom dtb more concerned
by backward compatibility (i.e. new kernel with old dtb) rather than old
kernel on new dtb? If they have an old dtb, an old kernel, and update to
a new kernel, backward compatibility will ensure this continues to work.
If then they work on updating their dtb, they still have the old one and
can make the distribution match dtb and kernel. This is already handled
properly by debian and I guess the other distributions as it is anyway
already matching kernel and initramfs.

This is what I have on my NAS:

$ ls /boot
config-4.12.0-1-marvell  initrd.img-4.12.0-1-marvell  uImage.bak
config-4.13.0-1-marvell  initrd.img-4.13.0-1-marvell  uInitrd
dtb                      initrd.img.old               uInitrd.bak
dtb-4.12.0-1-marvell     lost+found                   vmlinuz
dtb-4.13.0-1-marvell     System.map-4.12.0-1-marvell  vmlinuz-4.12.0-1-marvell
dtbs                     System.map-4.13.0-1-marvell  vmlinuz-4.13.0-1-marvell
initrd.img               uImage                       vmlinuz.old

So dtbs and kernels are already matching even when the dtbs didn't
change between 4.9 and 4.13.

I don't have any solution for the UEFI+grub use case but I will also
question the sanity of doing that ;)
