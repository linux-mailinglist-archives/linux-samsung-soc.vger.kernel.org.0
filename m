I had the same opinion, as you can see in my explanation to those
patches, but I failed. That's why I agree with Kamil's approach
because had higher chance to get into mainline and fix at least some
of the use cases.

I agree. I think this devfreq mechanism was designed in the times
where there was/were 1 or 2 CPUs in the system. After a while we got ~8
and not all of them are used. This scenario was probably not
experimented widely on mainline platforms.

That is a good material for improvements, for someone who has time and
power.
