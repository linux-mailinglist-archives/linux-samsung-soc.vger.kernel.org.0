If regulators are essential to system operation they should be marked as
always-on...

This then means that for users that might legitimately enable and
disable regulators that need to be constrained are forced to change the
voltage when they enable the regualtors in order to have their
constraints take effect which seems bad.  I'd rather change the the
cpufreq consumers to either not do the enable (since there really should
be an always-on constraint this should be redundant, we might need to
fix the core to take account of their settings though I think we lost
that) or to set the voltage to whatever they need prior to doing their
first enable, that seems more robust.
