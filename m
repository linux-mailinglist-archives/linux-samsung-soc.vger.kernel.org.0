Why not and what are we supposed to do about that? It's probably worth
pointing out that the majority of arm64-based SoCs have been using the arch
timer for *years* without problems. So I reckon you can make it work too.

You can do whatever you like downstream, but the upstream position is that
the arch timer is preferred: it's an architected solution from Arm which
supports things like virtualisation and userspace access. It's also a damn
sight quicker to access than the MCT.

On the downside, it's not usually possible to use it as a wakeup source,
so that's a great place for the MCT to shine. I've literally written the
code for you to do this.

Anyway, this MCTv2 driver is a dead duck whatever we do. Extend the existing
driver please.
