They are not heavily dependent on Chanwoo's patches.
Yes, they can be picked up independently.
I just wanted to mention that the patch 1/2 was produced on the
code base which had already applied Chanwoo's patch for DMC.
If you like to take both 1/2 and 2/2 into your tree, it's good.

Thank you for having a look on this.
