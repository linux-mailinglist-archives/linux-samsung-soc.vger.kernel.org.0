PLL could be changed by clock device driver in the linux kernel.
If you don't add the supported frequency into PLL frequency table 
of clock device driver, will fail to change the wanted frequency
on the linux kernel. It means that it is not fixed by only touching
the bootloader. 

As you commented, the wrong opp points which are specified on dt
cause this issue. Usually, have to initialize the clock rate on dt
by using 'assigned-clocks-*' property and then use the clock
with the preferable clock rate. I think that we have to fix
the fundamental problem. 

Without bootloader problem, you can fix it by initializing
the clock on dt with 'assigned-clocks-*' property.

As I knew that it is correct way and I always tried to do this method
for resolving the similar clock issue.

Lastly, I think that my opinion is more simple and correct.
It could give the more correct information to linux kernel user
which refer to the device tree file.

1. Your suggestion 
	a. Add opp-table with unsupported frequency on dt
	b. Try to change the clock rate on exynos-bus.c by using unsupported frequency from opp-table
	c. If failed, retry to change the clock rate on exynos-bus.c

2. My opinion
	a. Initialize the PLL or any clock by using assigned-clock-* property on dt
	   and add opp-table with supported frequency on dt
	b. Try to change the clock rate on exynos-bus.c by using supported frequency from opp-table
