Ah, sorry! I didn't know how to represent the tab character in a text
email. You have to replace the \t with a tab character (Ctrl-V Tab if
you're in bash). I should have stated that.

OK, fair enough. So the requirements for the SoC-level tree seem to be:

1. The base can be validated on its own.

2. It's obvious that the base isn't "complete" by itself.

3. We expect the top-level compatible string to continue to be
built-up until we consider something a "complete" device tree, so we
need a scheme for this.

Did I miss anything?

Those feel like solvable problems.

Looking at what's downstream, we do appear to be doing M x N
validation where M =3D number of SoCs and N =3D known boards. I'd agree,
that doesn't scale super well. That being said:

1. It's not expected for the number of SoC to scale up very high. I
suspect it would be super rare that a given board could be made to
boot with more than a small handful of different SoCs. Here I'm not
even just thinking about the needs of the Pixel team or Google, but in
general it seems like it would be pretty hard to make a board that
could handle a very big variety of SoCs. I think even if we scale this
to larger things like SoMs, the answer still feels the same. NOTE:
here, I'm only considering the problem of combining things until we
get a "complete" board (one where we're no longer expecting to munge
the top-level compatible string). If a SoM has enough stuff to be
considered "complete" (we stop munging the top-level compatible) then
I think we're back in the pre-existing overlay problem.

2. Even downstream, I believe it's really only the dev boards that
could have various SoCs plugged in. While it's possible someone made
the choice to build half of our "proto 0" boards with A0 stepping and
half with B0 stepping, I can't imagine that happening for more than
one board revision. Thus if D is the number of boards that could have
more than one SoC, the validation would actually be (M x D) + (N - D).
It can be noted that this is the same number of device trees we'd need
to validate if we gave up on using overlays and simply included a full
device tree for every valid combination, like what we did with
Chromebooks.

As far as I can think of, the only way to decrease the amount of
validation would be if we declared some sort of "interface" for the
SoC tree. Then we validate that the SoC trees provide that interface
and we validate the overlays against that interface.

I can't imagine something like that being specified manually for
something as giant as the interface between a board and the SoC that
would let the board validate solely via the interface.

I also can't quite imagine a tool that could somehow analyze all of
the SoC trees and generate some sort of unified interface. The .yaml
files are allowed to have complex enough rules about properties
depending on other properties that it doesn't feel like you'd be able
to succeed.

That being said, I could imagine the idea of manually specifying an
interface for more constrained uses of overlays. For instance, it does
feel like you could maybe express an interface that a "cape" needed,
then validate the "cape" against that.

I'm going to _hope_ that solving this isn't a blocker at this point in time=
?

Hmmm, any way I can convince you that the problem is different? It
sounds as if it fundamentally breaks down into overlays that need to
munge the top-level compatible string and ones that don't.

Overlays that need to munge the top-level compatible string are likely
doing very complex things that are very tightly intertwined with the
tree they're overlaying atop. Yes, someone could pretend that there's
an ABI here and someone could try to build an out-of-tree overlay
against it, but I would argue that it's an unstable ABI you should
expect things to break.

Overlays that _don't_ need to munge the top-level compatible string
are doing things that are much more constrained and it feels like we
_could_ define a tight ABI to validate against. IMO, that's a very
interesting problem to solve, but it's not the problem I'm trying to
solve here.

I certainly appreciate all the work DT folks have done towards
validation and also to making sure that DTs are clean and sensible.
:-) I know my thoughts on the sanctity of overall DT ABI don't always
match DT maintainers, though I certainly understand where you're
coming from and why it's a problem folks try to solve. In any case, I
don't believe that the rules I'm introducing here would interfere with
the sanctity of the overall DT ABI.

FWIW, my plan was to document all the compatible strings, but not
necessarily add support for everything. In this series, I added
support for just "-mp", though I'm booting the result on an EVT 1.1
device. With the barebones device tree I've added so far there is no
difference between EVT and MP and the bootloader is OK picking the MP
one since it can't find the EVT one.

Fair enough. It's something to keep in mind, but I _think_ this case
should be handled by my current ideas.

1. If the SoC, SoM, and board all need to add to the top-level
compatible then they use my scheme. All valid combinations need to be
enumerated in the kernel Makefile and no stable ABI is intended
between the SoC, SoM and board.

2. If the SoC and SoM together make a "complete" top-level compatible
and the board doesn't munge with it, then we just need all
combinations of the SoC / SoM to be enumerated in the kernel Makefile
and the board simply falls into the existing "it's an overlay"
scenario.


So anything that is an "incomplete" tree (doesn't have a full
compatible string) is marked as such. TBD exactly how. Incomplete
trees can still be validated on their own. All valid users of
incomplete trees must be stored together with them so they can be
validated, and all possible combinations must be enumerated. No ABI is
provided from an incomplete tree to an overlay that wasn't enumerated.

Right. It was the only usecase I could come up with where having the
base device tree compatible name was both necessary and sufficient for
knowing if an overlay should be applied. :-)

I talked about this a bit in the 4th patch in this series. In my mind,
every possible "loader" of the overlays will need different
information, so there shouldn't be just one scheme. I explored that
idea a bit [1] and I proposed something like this:

/ {
  loaders {
    mkdtimg {
      board-id =3D <0x1234>;
      board-rev =3D <0x5678>;
    };
    other-loader {
      something-else  <0xaaaa>;
    };
  };

Then under the "loaders" node we have node names that need to match
exactly for various loaders and then properties that they need. That's
just a quick proposal for the syntax, so happy for that to change. We
would definitely want to add some sort of bindings doc to let us
validate that.

Yes, clearly there could be lots of "loaders" out there, but I would
expect this number to be fairly constrained? If nothing else, if you
think someone's loader isn't worth supporting I guess you could deny
their bindings...

I have no idea what "loader" (other than "higher-level software or
firmware") is intended to consume the "overlay-compatible" of the
proposal you pointed at, but information that could go into the
bindings doc and would actually help me understand why the base device
tree compatible name was necessary and sufficient. :-) NOTE: if two
loaders can both use the same information, that's certainly OK too. We
could name the node after the loader that came first, right?


You correctly point out that I've encoded possible combinations in the
Makefile, but this is more in terms of enumerating possible
combinations so they can be validated. It does nothing to help the
loader pick the right one.

Sure, though I think the problem has been discussed at length in a
number of situations before (mailing lists, conferences, etc). Each
time it seems like it ends up being too complicated and folks hit dead
ends and stop trying to upstream. Downstream just keeps doing their
own downstream things because there are tons of people all hitting the
same problem and there's no upstream solution.

IMO we need to start moving into the realm of solutions. I understand
that upstream doesn't want to accept some poorly-thought-out scheme
that will cause long-term grief, but at some point it feels like we
need to accept something that's "not too bad" so that we can at least
iterate from there.

After re-reading all the above, it feels like we're not that far from
a solution, though perhaps you'll read it all and say that you hate it
and that we're not as close as I thought. ;-)
