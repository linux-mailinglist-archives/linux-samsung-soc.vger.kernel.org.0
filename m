So this will be dev board... If you plug this into dev board, then I
claim that your compatible must be specific for this system thus
describe that product, which is SoC and devboard, not SoC alone.

You still have dev board thus need dev board compatible.

Linux cannot execute instructions on this SoC alone. You need dev board.

My clumsy fingers were just example, but you simply cannot run any
software on this SoC without something else.

Virtual models and virtual platforms could be run without that
"something else" and they are allowed to have just the compatible. See
all the FVPs and QEMU platforms.

Then show me executing any piece of software, which is the consumer of
the bindings, and runs on the SoC without the rest of the hardware system.

We write bindings for users. There is no user of SoC and such compatible
alone. There is no such real use case.

Your use case is broken bootloader which pretends there is no board, but
there is a board, someone just did not want to admit it.

We don't develop for such use cases.

Didn't you just describe an overlay or DTSI file?
