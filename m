Thanks for explanations. If I understand correctly, your SoB appears
because some internal Samsung rules. That is not what SoB is meant
for:
https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.3-rc8/source/Documentation/process/submitting-patches.rst#L431
If you do not contributed to the patch, did not touch it (e.g.
rebasing) and you are not sending it, then your SoB should not be
there. It looks like the same madness with Kyungmin Park long time
ago:
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/krzk/linux.git/commit/?h=for-next&id=6c6cf64b16438eac6da9a90412a82316ad196e7c
Every patch was marked with SoB even though he was not involved at all
in the process.

That's not what kernel's SoB is for.

Best regards,
Krzysztof
