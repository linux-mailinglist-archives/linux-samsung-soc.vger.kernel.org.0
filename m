I'm not convinced that this definition is as clear as you're making it
out to be. It's physically impossible to run many "boards" alone.

Want to boot up a Raspberry Pi? Provide it with power. Hook up a
display to it. Hook up a keyboard to it. Plug in an Ethernet cable.
Plug an SD card in it. Without those things it doesn't run.

Want to boot up a lga-B0 SoC? Hook up power to the power pins. Connect
a MIPI panel to the MIPI pins. Connect a UFS chip to the UFS pins.
Without those things it doesn't run.

Yes, the complexity of just "hooking up" the components on an SoC is
an order of magnitude harder than a Raspberry Pi, but it's still just
hooking it up to external components. In both cases, we are modeling
the core "brains" (the part that contains the processor) as the DTB
and everything else just "hooks up" to interfaces.

If I had to make a definition for what the base DTB should be it
should be the component with the boot CPU. _Why_ is that the wrong
definition?


> There are few - one or two - exceptions for the SoMs, but never for SoC.

OK, but the big question: _WHY???_

Where does it say that a DTB has to be something that can run "alone"
and (most importantly) what benefit do we get for making that
requirement (AKA _WHY_)? This is the question you're not answering.
From Rob's response, he doesn't seem to think that a DTB needs to be
for something that can boot alone and he seems OK with allowing a
fairly flexible split here. Rob's response was focused on making sure
we can do validation and I'd love to continue on with that discussion.

Probably not worth continuing to discuss until we can agree that the
SoC can be in its own dtb. If we can agree upon that we can talk about
if we need the SoC part in the top-level compatible and how to
accomplish that. I had a few ideas / suggestions in my response to Rob
that roughly break down into:

* Don't model the SoC in the top-level compatible. Maybe put it in the
soc@0 node.

* Come up with a rule for "merging" top-level compatibles if a base
and overlay both define.

Whatever solution we come up with, I want to make sure it handles our
socketed dev boards where the SoC can be removed and replaced with a
different one.

For the sake of clarity, I'll go with this:

properties:
  ...
  ...
  ect:
    type: object
    additionalProperties: false

allOf:
  # Bootloader requires empty ect node to be present
  - if:
      properties:
        compatible:
          contains:
            const: google,gs101
    then:
      required:
      - ect

additionalProperties: true
