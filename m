Ah, I see. So you keep it as synchronous _and_ make it so that it
won't get a dummy. Yeah, I was trying to brainstorm ways we could fix
it if we kept the regulator async. If we keep it as sync and fix the
dummy problem then, indeed, it should work as you say.

I've spent a whole lot of time dealing with similar issues, though,
and I think there is actually another related concern with that design
(where the regulator is synchronous). ;-) If the child device ends up
depending on a resource that _never_ shows up then you can get into an
infinite probe deferral loop at bootup. If it works the way it did
last time I analyzed similar code:

1. Your MFD starts to probe and kicks off probing of its children
(including the regulator).

2. Your regulator tries to probe and tries to get a resource that will
never exist, maybe because of a bug in dts or maybe because it won't
show up until userspace loads a module. It returns -EPROBE_DEFER.

3. The MFD realizes that the regulator didn't come up and it also
returns -EPROBE_DEFER after removing all its children.

4. That fact that we added/removed devices in the above means that the
kernel thinks it should retry probes of previously deferred devices
because, maybe, the device showed up that everyone was waiting for.
Thus, we go back to step #1.

...the system can actually loop forever in steps #1 - #4 and we ended
up in that situation several times during development with similar
architected systems.
