Obviously at the grub and kernel level we support only 1 DTB. No one
is debating that here. Can we back up and stop debating implementation
details.

The problem is in early boot before there's DT used where you
determine the SoC and/or board at runtime and need to load the DTB
from that information. Both are dynamic in Google's case, but it could
easily be only the SoC or only the board is determined at runtime.
There's another similar usecase of booting a SoM with a SoM DT and
then applying the baseboard DT overlay. You could want to do both in
the same system. Your options are either have every possible
combination as a full DT or have a way to combine them at runtime in
some way. I'm pretty certain the answer for the former will be there's
not enough storage. So that leaves the latter option.

The only real answers here are a) your usecase is not valid or b) how
to implement the usecase.
