Sure, except that leaves us with ... a breakage. :-P

Although I haven't tested it, I have a hard time believing that
exynos5250-snow and exynos5420-peach-pit will work properly with the
panel defined as an eDP panel. That means that they will be broken. If
someone cared to get those fixed in a stable backport then we'd be
stuck deciding who to break. If you have any brilliant ideas then I'm
all ears.

...then again, I presume this has been broken since commit
88d3457ceb82 ("drm/panel: auo,b116xw03: fix flash backlight when power
on"). That was a little over 3 years ago. Maybe I'm wrong and somehow
things still limp along and sorta work even though the panel is
defined incorrectly?
