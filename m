What happens if I add a MIPI-DSI --> HDMI bridge to the Display pipeline? Then
the Pipeline is

Display Controller --> MIPI DSI bus device --> HDMI bridge --> HDMI Panel

If the type of the Display panel decides which part of the pipeline provides
the encoder, the HDMI bridge driver would be responsible for creating the
encoder, right? Thus, the MIPI-DSI driver would not be responsible for
creating the encoder and would also get the encoder from another driver.
Therefore, I prefer to think of the Display Controller as the encoder and
other bridges are just bridges.

BTW, this is exactly the Display pipeline that is used on the i.MX8MM EVK.

Yes, but the IMX DRM driver is not used on the i.MX8MM. The i.MX8MM uses the
LCDIF display controller instead of the IPU of the i.MX6. The driver for the
LCDIF is the mxsfb driver, which in turn uses the drm_simple_display_pipe,
which already provides the encoder. Therefore, to use a bridge driver with a
driver based on a drm_simple_display_pipe, the bridge driver must accept other
encoders.
