Hey Maxime,
  Sorry for taking so long to get to this, but now that plumbers is
over I've had a chance to check it out on kirin

Rob Clark pointed me to his branch with some fixups here:
   https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/robclark/msm/-/commits/for-mripard/bridge-rework

But trying to boot hikey with that, I see the following loop indefinitely:
[    4.632132] adv7511 2-0039: supply avdd not found, using dummy regulator
[    4.638961] adv7511 2-0039: supply dvdd not found, using dummy regulator

I'll have to dig a bit to figure out what's going wrong, but wanted to
give you the heads up that there seems to be a problem

thanks
