I don't understand, why the MIPI-DSI bus device would be an encoder type and
DSI to LVDS or MIPI-DSI to HDMI would be bridges. For example, the device tree
documentation for the DSIM states that the DSIM receives RGB video as input
and produces MIPI-DSI as output. Thus, the DSIM is basically a parallel RGB to
MIPI-DSI bridge and the encoder is the LCD controller that encodes the video
data as parallel RGB.

On the i.MX8MM, the LCDIF is already the encoder. On Exynos, the series
implements the encoder in the platform glue, but in the end the encoder can
probably be moved to the DECON.

Yes, the reason is that the driver should be shared between Exynos and
i.MX8MM. It is the same IP and I don't see a reason why we should introduce
another driver for the same IP if the driver works for both SoCs.
