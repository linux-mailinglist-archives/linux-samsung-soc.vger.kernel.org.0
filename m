See comment a bit further down about using a dedicated compatible.
Also I think it's probably worth thinking about it conceptually as 3
things
1) Ensuring the application specific values and initial registers are
initialized like downstream does from DT (DesignCap, CONFIG register
etc)
2) Loading the M5 model gauge algorithm
3) Saving and restoring the "algorithm configuration" values to nvmem
and re-loading them on a fresh boot.

Most of the code for these features is in the following file
https://android.googlesource.com/kernel/google-modules/bms/+/1a68c36bef4745=
73cc8629cc1d121eb6a81ab68c/max_m5.c

Bit 5 is "LdMdl" see

73cc8629cc1d121eb6a81ab68c/max_m5_reg.h#1489
It is set to 1 to initiate loading a model, and firmware clears the
bit to zero to indicate model loading is finished. You can see more
info about how this works

Some of those registers like RepCap, Cycles, FullCapNom are ModelGauge
algorithm outputs.

Others like DQACC, DPACC, RCOMP0 are part of the values that should be
saved and restored to some nvmem. You can see the function here that
does this https://android.googlesource.com/kernel/google-modules/bms/+/1a68=

Ah that explains it then, as Andre mentioned he thought this reported
a correct value in a previous version. It might be worth adding that
info in the cover letter of future versions.

We don't really pass register values like the downstream driver is
doing in the device tree. I think you will likely need to add a
max77759-gs101-oriole compatible to the driver and then have the
application specific values, and m5 gauge model algorithm as static
info in the driver applied from the dedicated compatible. It would
also be worth checking whether any more of those register values can
be represented by the standard power-supply binding properties that
already exist.

Nope, that was more for my own benefit when doing the review :)
