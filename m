Fair enough. Is the right answer to add a special rule when applying
overlays to base dtbs? If both the base DTB and the overlay contain a
top-level compatible, should we merge the two instead of having the
overlay replace the base property? Would that be right in all cases?

Specifically, if we were to look at how we handle our dev boards that
are socketed and can handle either SoC rev A0 or SoC rev B0, I guess
the top-level compatible string somehow needs to indicate this
somehow? If we "merged" the compatible strings of the board and the
SoC?

So if we had a deepspace (devboard) with a A0 rev SoC:

base (lga A0):
  google,soc-id-0005-rev-00, google,lga

overlay (deepspace devboard 1)
  google,pixel-id-070101-rev-010000

Final compatible:
  google,pixel-id-070101-rev-010000, google,soc-id-0005-rev-00, google,lga

If we had a deepspace with a B0 rev SoC:

base (lga A0):
  google,soc-id-0005-rev-10, google,lga

overlay (deepspace devboard 1)
  google,pixel-id-070101-rev-010000

Final compatible:
  google,pixel-id-070101-rev-010000, google,soc-id-0005-rev-10, google,lga


...is that what you're thinking? Of course, it still somehow feels
cleaner to me to put the SoC compatible under the "soc@0" node, though
I know that goes against "tradition"... If we did that then the base
SoC "dtb" doesn't need a compatible at all and the board would _just_
have its own compatible.


NOTE: I don't think this is a novel problem. There are already
existing overlays that mess with the top-level compatible...

grep '^\tcompatible' $(find arch/arm64/boot/dts -name '*.dtso')

I guess, in theory, we could solve this by simply not trying to
validate the SoC "dts" file on its own. Is this as simple as giving it
its own filename suffix? Do we just call it "lga-b0.dtsb" or for
"device tree source base", or something like that? Then we add kernel
rules where we don't validate that on its own but only validate it
together with overlays?

To keep the problem smaller / easier to think about and not try to
solve all existing problems: the only case we're worried about at the
moment is when the base device tree and all overlays are generated at
the same time. That feels like it might be an easier case to handle?

I suspect that nearly all of them are useful, though _possibly_ some
of the early proto devices can be removed?

Specifically, engineers at Google will be supporting these devices for
many many years to come. Newer Pixel phones have something like an
8-year support life during which engineers will need to continue to
support them. From my experience on the Pixel team, unless you can
demonstrate a need for something newer it's common to get assigned EVT
1 or EVT 1.1 devices when you request hardware, even for older phones.

Even if end users are unlikely to need these, having them supported
will be essential for those at Google who need to support the product
as a whole.

We've had similar discussions in the past about Chromebooks and the
need to support old hardware, which is why Chromebooks have many
revisions supported. I can tell you that when we tried to drop old
revisions in the past I had angry people come and visit me.

The key here is that combining happens in the bootloader. The
bootloader boots up and has its own (non-device tree ways) to handle
things. It then looks at the SoC ID register, looks at the IDs that
tell it what board it's running on, and picks a base DTB (representing
the SoC) and an overlay (representing the board). It combines these
two and passes a single unified device tree to Linux.

Maybe this is a key difference between what we're doing and what
you're thinking of? We're not trying to boot the main OS with just the
base.

Perhaps I don't understand the proposal, but it doesn't seem useful to
me (?) or at least it's not relevant to the problem we're trying to
solve here.

If I had to guess, I'd say the problem they're trying to solve there
is that they've got some external peripherals (like an i2c-connected
dohickey). They want to ship their dohickey to customers and tell
customers that they can attach the dohickey to any of a number of
devboards. If a customer attaches their dohickey to a Raspberry Pi it
should go on, let's say, i2c5. If it's on a Beagleboard they'll say it
belongs on i2c3. On an stm32 it belongs on i2c11. So they distribute a
bunch of "dtbo" files with their dohickey, one for each target
devboard. This mechanism allows a loader to figure out which devboard
is running and which overlay should be loaded. Is that right?


In our case, the problem is very different. We're really just trying
to pick together all the pieces that make up a full system.
