Thank you Markus for providing to Bernard helpful suggestions.

@Bernard please read the link above and send v3

Something like: 'memory/samsung: reduce protected code area in IRQ
handler' for the subject header would be better.
Then in the message explain (without 'maybe') that it will speed-up a
bit this IRQ processing and there is no need to protect return value or
printing.

Lukasz
