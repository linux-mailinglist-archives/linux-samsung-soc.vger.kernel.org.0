I'm not sure I can contribute that much to this discussion (this is my
first proper kernel patch, also I don't really understand the argument).
FWIW I looked at other MFD devices while implementing this like max77836,=
=20
max77693, max77650, max77843 (just to name a few).=20
Assigning of_node to sub-devices using sub-nodes with compatible strings=20
seemed to be a common pattern for MFD devices.
Muic needs a node to be used with extcon_get_edev_by_phandle().
Charger needs a node to reference a regulator.
