Nothing 'broke' as such (the board continued booting) but the WARN
shouldn't be happening. My CI treats the WARN as a failure as these
shouldn't occur unless there's a programming error.

So one possibility is to include this platform in the exclusion list -
but I'm not sure how to do that, I assume including CONFIG_ARM in the
list would rather defeat the point of the patch. But my feeling is that
it would involve a lot of playing whack-a-mole to identify individual
platforms.

One obvious idea would be to look at the DTBs in the kernel tree and see
which are affected by this currently, that might be a good place to
start with an exclusion list.

You could also downgrade the warning to a pr_warn() or similar.

I don't have any particular suggestions other than above, I just wanted
to report an existing DTB that triggers this WARN. We need to resolve
this one way or another before this patch can progress. For now I've
simply reverted this patch for my CI.
