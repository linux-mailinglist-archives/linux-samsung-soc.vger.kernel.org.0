Modules *should* work.  William is going to try it out.

Might need to lean-on for some testing on different H/W though.

One of the on-going issues that GKI aims to solve pertains to the
disparity between what upstream engineers would like to be upstreamed
(i.e. everything) and what vendors can upstream (i.e. most things).

The old Open Source vs Business (i.e. products/real-life) struggle!

Vendors are not able to upstream all functionality right away, as it
would give away their perceived edge on the competition (i.e. other
vendors).  This is something we just have to accept as it will *never*
change.

GKI attempts to solve this issue by providing a generic core
containing all of the elements required to get every supported
platform bootstrapped to a point where modules can be loaded and
additional functionality can be brought in.  GKI provides all of the
modules available from the upstream kernel BUT allows them to be
overwritten/swapped-out by modules containing code (new/shiny
unreleased value-add) that the vendors do not wish to share (yet).

Clever, eh!

As I've explained before, the trigger for all of this was
SERIAL_SAMSUNG which is required for early console on supported
Samsung platforms i.e. this symbol *has* to be built-in.  In order for
this to built-in ARCH_EXYNOS has to be enabled due to the listed
dependencies in Kconfig.  And since ARCH_EXYNOS 'selects' all of these
different extra symbols, it means they too will be built-in, meaning
that a) the core binary will be unnecessarily bloated and b) vendors
who wish to overwrite/replace this functionality with their
non-shareable value-add, are not able to do so.

Going forward, it sounds like the best approach that will make
everyone happy, providing it's technically feasible, is to enable
these added (sometimes required, other times superfluous) symbols as
loadable modules.
