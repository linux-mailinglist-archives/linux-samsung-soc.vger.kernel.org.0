Yeah, that clock is definitely needed. Just submitted the series [1]
adding it, which makes the kernel stuck on startup when your series is
applied. To fix that I added next lines to the TMU node in dts:

8<-------------------------------------------------------------------------=
-->8
     tmuctrl_0: tmu@10070000 {
         compatible =3D "samsung,exynos850-tmu";
         reg =3D <0x10070000 0x800>;
         interrupts =3D <GIC_SPI 226 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_HIGH>;
+        clock-names =3D "tmu_apbif";
+        clocks =3D <&cmu_peri CLK_GOUT_BUSIF_TMU_PCLK>;
         #thermal-sensor-cells =3D <0>;
    };
8<-------------------------------------------------------------------------=
-->8

Please rework your patches to account for that required clock. Alas
the TMU dts changes can't be submitted until my series [1] is applied.
But you can still apply my series locally, and I think the driver and
bindings changes don't depend on that clock, so it should be ok to
send those

Thanks!
