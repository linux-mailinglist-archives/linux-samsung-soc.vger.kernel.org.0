What limitations? Are you thinking of a known issue, or just in case
there is a bug in future HW?

If there is a problem, we'll need to describe that in the DT somehow,
and we need to know speciifcally what that limitation is.

Above you said that Will's suggestion will definitely work, which
implies no such limitations.

Thanks,
Mark.
