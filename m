IIRC I've done this experiment, still keeping in devfreq:
INIT_DEFERRABLE_WORK()
just applying patch [1]. It uses a system_wq which should
be the same as system_power_efficient_wq when
CONFIG_WQ_POWER_EFFICIENT_DEFAULT is not set (our case).
This wasn't solving the issue for the deferred work. That's
why the patch 2/2 following patch 1/2 [1] was needed.

The deferred work uses TIMER_DEFERRABLE in it's initialization
and this is the problem. When the deferred work was queued on a CPU,
next that CPU went idle, the work was not migrated to some other CPU.
The former cpu is also not woken up according to the documentation [2].

That's why Kamil's approach should be continue IMHO. It gives more
control over important devices like: bus, dmc, gpu, which utilization
does not strictly correspond to cpu utilization (which might be low or
even 0 and cpu put into idle).

I think Kamil was pointing out also some other issues not only dmc
(buses probably), but I realized too late to help him.

Lukasz
