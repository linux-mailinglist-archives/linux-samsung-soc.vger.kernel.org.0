Permanent modules just don't have a module_exit() hook, so that is
pretty easy to look for.
Obviously, I don't want to add more burden to the maintainership.

From a given clockevent driver (or maybe a function pointer), we could
check on the registration by calling __module_address(addr) [thanks to
Sami Tolvanen for pointing that function out to me] on one of the
function pointers provided, and check that there isn't a module->exit
pointer.

For clocksources we already have an owner pointer in the clocksource
struct that the driver is supposed to set if it's a module, but
clocksources already handle the get/puts needed to prevent modules
unloading under us.

The clocksource code already has support for modules, and will do the
module_get and call enable hooks before switching to the new
clocksource. So the clocksource from the module has to be functioning
and running before timekeeping switches to using it.

By drift, its true changing clocksources can change the underlying
crystal so NTP has to begin again to determine any long-term frequency
adjustment needed, but we signal that properly.  And there should be
no time inconsistency during the switch as we accumulate everything
from the current clocksource and read a new base value from the new
clocksource. If there is, it's a bug.

So separately from this patch submission, I agree that the GKI
approach does not enforce vendor participation upstream. But there is
no rule *anywhere* that makes folks participate, and with the old
vendor trees it was definitely worse.

The GKI does result in vendors having a common interest in the
*actual* common portions of the kernel to be working well, so we can
make sure things like bug fixes, etc are submitted upstream first.
That is a clear benefit over separate vendor trees, but it's not a
magic tool to get everyone submitting all of their code upstream.

Trying to cajole upstream participation via barriers (not supporting
modular drivers upstream to try to enforce vendors submit patches to
add built in drivers for support) won't really work because they will
just be enabled as modules anyway out of tree. And it's hard to argue
against, as there isn't really a technical benefit to the GKI
requiring lots of SoC specific hardware support be built in.  So it
only ends up being another reason to not bother with upstream.

<Sorry, I'm getting a bit soap-boxy here>
I personally think the best tool we have to improve participation and
collaboration with the community is to do what we can to make it a
positive/beneficial/worthwhile experience. Every time I've submitted
patches and had bugs pointed out or fixes suggested, is a huge value
to me, and I have tremendous appreciation for folks sharing their
knowledge and expertise. And every time a patch I send gets merged or
a bug I reported ends up being fixed, there is a real sense of pride
in the contribution made to such an important project. Then, to get to
a point of a maintainership, and to be able to consider these amazing
influential developers as (relative)peers feels like such a career
accomplishment!  As an individual, those moments feel awesome and
motivate me over and over to want to reach out and share patches or
issues or thoughts.

And yes, there are organizations that focus more on how to exploit the
community for their benefit without contributing, and I get the
protective reaction that maintainers have to that. But I also know
there is *a lot* of amazing expertise inside the heads of
*individuals* who don't participate because they don't feel the "us vs
them" combative interactions are worth it. I think we/the community
are missing out, and those folks are the ones we should be trying to
welcome and include in order to build up our community.

Maintainers and the community need to keep high technical standards
and make the right long term choices, and developers won't agree all
the time on what those are, and I think that's all fine! But I think
if we want to grow the community and have more participation (as well
as growing folks into maintainers), I think we'll have more success
focusing on the honey than the vinegar.

thanks
