Is Android universal enough? As mentioned above, Android defines some
fields that it wants in its DTBO partition header. I am doubtful we
could generalize further, since each bootloader scheme wants different
things.

That is indeed not great. I believe this part predates the DTBO partition
format, and is also related to how vendors split their base DTB and
overlays, such as the scheme Doug presented.

Maybe the new Android Generic Boot Loader (GBL) work will provide
unification. I will reach out to them to see what's happening in that space=
.

Rob provided it in the other thread. The per-overlay compatible allows
identifying the overlay instead of using the filename, which I think
is much appreciated. But we still need a mapping of what a final device
compatible breaks down to.

For example, say we have the the following:

- product common base "google,yoda" (DTB)
- codec option one "google,yoda-codec-rt5682i" (DTBO)
- codec option two "google,yoda-codec-rt5682s" (DTBO)
- WWAN module and SAR sensor option "google,yoda,wwan" (DTBO)

We then have different SKUs that are a combination of the above:

- product SKU "google,yoda-sku0"
  combine "google,yoda", "google,yoda-codec-rt5682s", and "google,yoda,wwan=
"

- product SKU "google,yoda-sku4"
  combine "google,yoda", "google,yoda-codec-rt5682i", and "google,yoda,wwan=
"

- product SKU "google,yoda-sku16"
  combine "google,yoda" and "google,yoda-codec-rt5682s"

This is the mapping we have to put _somewhere_. The bootloader only
knows about "google,yoda-skuXYZ" and "google,yoda", as described in
the Chromebook boot flow document [1].

Now I suppose we could have per-SKU DTBOs that just update the base
compatible string, and have Makefile rules put them all together.
But we have something like 32 SKUs just for this product alone, and
I don't think we want to add that many dtso files. The whole reason
for us to switch to overlays was to avoid the explosion of SKU-based
DTB files.
