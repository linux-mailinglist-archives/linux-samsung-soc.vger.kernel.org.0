I agree with this approach. If devfreq is unusable on that platform,
let's try disabling the exynos-bus nodes. It could be enough to help.
The opp-shared does not look like proper fix for this problem, but
rather a incorrect solution which achieves the same result - disabling
frequency/voltage scaling on some buses.

Yes, I saw it as well. However defconfig is only defconfig, so customers
still would be affected and still might report bugs for it. Maybe better
to disable all exynos-bus nodes?

Best regards,
