Please mention that this is a two-OS case (or without cache coherency),

I see, thanks for explanation. In such case it might not be a separate
compatible (programming model is the same) but rather dedicated property
or properties in DTS to indicate that some parts are shared with other
system. If property is present, you skip FRC initialization and use
local timers. You actually might need two properties - one for A53 and
one for A5. Or some kind of map to assign subset of local interrupts to
each of the systems.

I think still that DTS is the right place for it because it is a
property of hardware and it's too early in system boot to use some
remote-proc or mailbox...

Best regards,
Krzysztof
