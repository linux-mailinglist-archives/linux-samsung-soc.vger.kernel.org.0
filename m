It has MMC controller/slot described in the DTS and the SDcard itself is
DT-transparent, meaning you do not describe it in DTS, plus I can easily
insert such card, thus for sake of this discussion that RPi still works
fine with DTS.

This SoC cannot work without other pieces described in DT, that's why it
is incomplete and unusable on its own.

You are right that my previous arguments of hooking components are
incomplete, so let me rephrase it - the DTS file should be complete from
DT point of view and completly usable on its own. That's why DTS
represents board (with the exceptions of few SoMs as explaiend to me
long time ago).

SoC does not meet this criteria, therefore it is not suitable for DTS.

And if you claim that SoC could be fitting DTS, then I claim that
individual transistor or one IP block like DWC USB3 could be there as
well. With your arguments we could create DTS files for DWC USB3 nodes.
Fact that transistor or DWC USB3 cannot execute code on their own does
not matter, because it is nowhere said that DTS represents something
which can execute code. CPU executes code, so following this argument
DTS could contain only CPU device nodes..

If we allow subpieces, like SoC components or SoCs (both still unusable
on their own), as DTS files we open the pandora box of all possible
styles and formats. I don't see reasoon why would we want it, what
benefits this would bring to the ecosystem maintenance.

We did not document it that DTS represents usable board, but it is
implied all over the software projects, like GRUB devicetree [1] which
takes one DTB to load. Only one.
