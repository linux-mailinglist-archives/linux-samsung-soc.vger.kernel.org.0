Hi Lukasz,

As you remember in January Chanwoo has proposed another idea (to allow
selecting workqueue type by devfreq device driver):

"I'm developing the RFC patch and then I'll send it as soon as possible."
(https://lore.kernel.org/linux-pm/6107fa2b-81ad-060d-89a2-d8941ac4d17e@samsung.com/)

"After posting my suggestion, we can discuss it"
(https://lore.kernel.org/linux-pm/f5c5cd64-b72c-2802-f6ea-ab3d28483260@samsung.com/)

so we have been waiting on the patch to be posted..

Similarly we have been waiting on (any) feedback for exynos-bus/nocp
fixes for Exynos5422 support (which have been posted by Kamil also in
January):

https://lore.kernel.org/linux-pm/8f82d8d5-927b-afb4-272f-45c16b5a23b9@samsung.com/

Considering the above and how hard it has been to push the changes
through review/merge process last year we are near giving up when it
comes to upstream devfreq contributions. Sylwester is still working on
exynos-bus & interconnect integration (continuation of Artur Swigon's
work from last year) & related issues (IRQ support for PPMU)  but
I'm seriously considering putting it all on-hold..

Best regards,
