Currently the MFD parent/core driver will instantiate children
unconditionally.  It would have to be adapted. With proposed bindings -
nothing to change.  MFD core already does the thing.

The point is that function drivers should not be even bound, should not
start to probe. Otherwise if they probe and fail, they will pollute the
dmesg/probe log with failure. With the failure coming from looking for
missing of_node or any other condition from parent/core driver.

I am rather thinking about charger, but yes, extcon as well. Either you
have USB socket (and want to use associated logic) or not.

Best regards,
