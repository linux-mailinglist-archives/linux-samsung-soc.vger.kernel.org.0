Sweet! I wasn't aware of this file at all.

However, on a side note, one of my TODO items is to not add devices to
the deferred probe list if they'll never probe yet (due to suppliers
not having probed). On a board I tested on, it cut down really_probe()
calls by 75%! So the probe attempt itself effectively happens in graph
order (which I think is pretty cool). So that's going to conflict with
this file. I'll have to see what to do about that.

Thanks for this pointer. Let me sit on this for 2 weeks and see how I
can incorporate your suggestion while allowing for the above. And then
I'll send out a patch. Does that work?
