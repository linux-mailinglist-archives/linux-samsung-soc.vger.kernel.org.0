Ummm, OK. In any case, I'm going to wait until our discussion in the
bindings patch about whether SoCs can be final compatibles, then if I
still think extra discussion is needed I'll respond more on this
thread.

Perhaps you have a link to Rob's comment from a long time ago?

As per my comment "after the cut" in the original patch (see above),
for my use case, I'm OK with removing the "board-id" and "board-rev"
here. It wouldn't be terribly hard to teach my tool to parse the
top-level compatible. That being said, it would be nice to allow them
at a top-level like this. As Chen-Yu says, there are other interested
parties.

The official documentation that I referred to in my comment "after the
cut" says this about properties directly in the overlays:

```
/dts-v1/;
/plugin/; /* allow undefined references and record them */
/ {
    .... /* various properties for loader use; i.e. part id etc. */
    fragment@0 {
```

So properties are clearly documented to be allowed here. When I read
the above, I interpret it as the properties are "whatever the expected
loader of this overlay would find convenient".

I am more than happy to document which properties my "loader"
(mkdtimg) needs if you have some proposed place or way for me to
document them. I'm happy to do it in freeform text (or markup) for now
if that's what people would accept. Maybe that lets us get started yet
still document things while we figure out what the needs are?

If you have more details or if Rob wants to re-iterate his thoughts,
I'm happy to discuss.

In my mind, I'd rather this not be a "compatible" but I'm also not
dead set on that. IMO, though it can be made to work, having a
"compatible" here is sorta backwards from what we want. We faced this
issue in ChromeOS when we used the top-level "compatible" to pick the
device tree. Specifically, the normal usage of "compatible" is to
start with the device tree which has a list of compatible strings.
From there, we pick a driver that matches. AKA: we start with some
"compatible" strings and find a matching "thing" (a driver). When
using a "compatible" to pick an overlay / device tree, we start with a
"thing" (a known board) and then pick a list of "compatible" strings
that matches it. Hopefully it's clear how that's a bit different.

As I said, the problems are mostly subtle, but this is how we ended up
with the weirdness on Chromebooks where we had a pile of all equal
"compatible" strings at the top level and that made all the DT folks
grumpy. See, for instance, the sc7180-trogdor-lazor-r1.dts file where
"google,lazor-rev1" and "google,lazor-rev2" are both there. We'll pick
this same DTS for both revisions.

It can be made to work, but IMO it's not a perfect fit.

I'd rather us just pick some standard property that documents the
information that the expected loader should need. Maybe you could even
handle more than one loader type?

/ {
  loaders {
    mkdtimg {
      board-id =3D <0x1234>;
      board-rev =3D <0x5678>;
    };
    other-loader {
      something-else  <0xaaaa>;
    };
  };

Then under the "loaders" node we have node names that need to match
exactly for various loaders and then properties that they need.

I haven't tested this, but I believe that since the "loaders" isn't
under any "fragment" that it will just be ignored when the overlay is
applied, so it will just be for the consumption of the loader.
