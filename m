HDMI bridge driver will create only an bridge because this is not encoder device but bridge device such as LVDS bridge.

Display Controller(CRTC) --> MIPI DSI bus device(Encoder) --> HDMI bridge(Bridge) --> HDMI Panel(Connector)

I think MIPI-DSI is an encoder device as I mentioned earlier so MIPI-DSI driver would be responsible for creating the encoder.

So crtc driver will create an encoder internally in case of parallel RGB Panel *because encoder device isn't used*. On the other hand, each encoder driver will be an encoder in case of other type of panel - which is needed for Display bus device such as MIPI-DSI device.
