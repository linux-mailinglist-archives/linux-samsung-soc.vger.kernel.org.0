I dug out a exynos5250-snow out of my pile and booted postmarket OS on
it, which was shockingly easy/pleasant (kudos to those involved!). I
found that it was booting a kernel based on 6.1.24. Digging into
sysfs, I found that indeed it appeared to be using the "panel-edp"
driver, so I guess it is limping along with the wrong driver and wrong
flags...

It wasn't totally clear for me how to build a new kernel and deploy it
for postmarket OS, so I wasn't able to confirm this change. I've CCed
the person listed on the postmarket OS wiki though to see if they have
any insight.

In any case, it sounds as if things are working well enough on older
OSes, so maybe we can just skip trying to do any stable backport on
this. It still seems like we should land it, though, since the current
state of the world seems pretty broken. Anyone willing to give a
Reviewed-by or Acked-by tag?
