I don't have user manuals, so all my knowledge here is based on
Exynos9825 vendor source code, therefore it is quite limited. In
devicetree the USI devices have their own nodes - but does it mean it's
separate SFR range dedicated to USI? Looks like that, especially that
address space is just for one register (4 bytes).

In such case having separate dedicated driver makes sense and you would
only have to care about driver ordering (e.g. via device links or phandles).

Option 2 looks interesting - reusing reset framework to set proper USI
mode, however this looks more like a hack. As you said Chanho, if there
is a USI version 3, this reset framework might not be sufficient.

In option 3 each driver (UART/I2C/SPI) would need to receive second IO
range and toggle some registers, which could be done via shared
function. If USI v3 is coming, all such drivers could get more complicated.

I think option 1 is the cleanest and extendable in future. It's easy to
add usi-v3 or whatever without modifying the UART/I2C/SPI drivers. It
also nicely encapsulates USI-related stuff in separate driver. Probe
ordering should not be a problem now.

But as I said, I don't have even the big picture here, so I rely on your
opinions more.

Best regards,
Krzysztof
