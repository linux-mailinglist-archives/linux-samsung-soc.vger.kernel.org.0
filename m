The response from remote always happens for the acpm protocol. Same for
the plain (no acpm or SRAM involved) mailbox controller that I see in
downstream.

While the response from remote always happens, the RX data is optional.
Clients can choose whether they want the data from the RX ring or not
(see `struct exynos_acpm_rx_data`).

For each message that is sent on the TX ring, it is expected that the
remote consumes it. The remote gets the message from the TX queue,
advances the rear index of the TX ring, processes the request, writes
the response message (if any) on the linux RX ring and advances the
front index of the linux RX ring.

> Anyway, the former is also supported by TXDONE_BY_ACK already.

If we want to focus on when TX is done and really be strict about it,
then for my case TX can be considered done when the remote consumes it.
I need to poll and check when the linux TX ring rear index is moved by
the remote. Other option is to poll the IRQ status register of the
remote to see when the request was consumed. So maybe TXDONE_BY_POLL is
more accurate?
TX can also be considered done after what we write to TX ring hits the
endpoint-SRAM, thus neither of these flags needed.

As a side nodeto IRQs, the acpm protocol allows channels to work either
in polling or in IRQ mode. I expect in the future we'll need to specify
the done method per channel and not per controller. IRQs are not used in
the downstream, thus I didn't touch them in this proposal.

They seem fine, I just wanted to see the implementation and decide
whether the request approach can be applied to them or not. I think it can.

No worries, it's fine to disagree.

It's not handled. I have a list of requirements I have to fulfill which
are not covered by the mailbox core:

1/ allow multiple TX in-flight. We need to let the controller handle its
hardware queue, otherwise the hardware queue has no sense at all.
2/ allow to tie a TX to a RX. I need to know to what TX the response
corresponds to.
3/ allow multiple clients to the same channel. ACPM allows this. Support
would have come as an extra patch.
4/ allow polling and IRQ channels for the same mailbox controller (not
urgent).

I guess that we agree that in order to allow multiple TX in-flight we
need a completion struct per message/request and not per channel. But we
disagree on the ability to tie a TX to a RX.

How can I move forward with this? No better options come to mind right
now. Shall I take the apple approach and move everything to drivers/soc?
If any of you has another idea, shoot.

Thanks,
ta
