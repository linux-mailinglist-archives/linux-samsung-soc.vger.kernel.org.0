This is probably the historical decision. That time when Exynos DSI 
driver has been implemented, support for DRM bridges wasn't ready enough 
to use to for such purpose.

Frankly, I'm still not convinced that the current DRM bridge framework 
provides everything needed to reimplement the Exynos DSI driver with all 
its features. There are a lots of corner cases and order-specific bits 
in turning on/off the display pipeline, which don't map nicely to the 
bridge pre_enable (called in post-order) and enable (called in 
pre-order) callbacks. Especially if you consider that there might be 
another bridge before and after.

I think that Andrzej Hajda already pointed those drawbacks of the 
current design. Last week I've spent some significant amount of time 
playing with exynos dsi code to check how to match its operations 
(especially the runtime power management) to this design with the 
current boards (Arndale with additional DSI->LVDS bridge and panel, 
Trats2 with DSI panel and TM2e with MIC 'in-bridge' and DSI panel), but 
without a success.

I think that the easiest way to share this driver between Exynos and iMX 
would be to extract the low-level code (the code that plays with 
hardware registers) to the common plane, while keeping the separate DRM 
glue, device component and platform device parts. This way the Exynos 
will continue to use it in the current form, while iMX can start using 
it as DRM bridge. A bit similar approach is used with exynos_dp driver 
and analogix_dp bridge shared with other SoCs.

I hope that later, when the bridge related issue are resolved, the 
Exynos can be converted too, so the encoder creation moved to FIMD and 
Decon.

Best regards
