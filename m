I don't think forward compatibility was ever considered. I've seen it
being mentioned a few times on #armlinux but honestly this simply can't
be achieved. This would mean being able to write complete DT bindings
for a particular SoC at day 0 which will realistically never happen. You
may noteven have a complete datasheet and even if you have a datasheet,
it may not be complete or it may be missing hw errata that are
discovered later on and need a new binding to handle.

Any serious update strategy will update both the kernel and device tree
at the same time, exactly like you already have to update the initramfs
with the kernel as soon as it is including kernel modules.
I would expect any embedded platform to actually use a container format,
like a FIT image that will ship the kernel, DT and intiramfs in a single
image and will allow to sign all parts.

Are there really any platforms with the dtb built into the firmware? I
feel like this is a mythical creature used to scare people into keeping
the DTB ABI stable. Aren't all the distribution already able to cope
with keeping DTB and kernel in sync?
