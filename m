That's quite generic statement... or let me put it that way - we already
have this ability to create a generic kernel supporting different SoCs.
Exynos and other ARMv7 and ARMv8 platforms are multiplatform.

Task is done.

Please be more specific about use case and describe what exactly in
current upstream multiplatform kernel is missing, what is not
multiplatform enough.

Since the disabling the driver for a kernel supporting Exynos does not
make any sense, then making it at least modular unfortunately it is a
requirement.

I would first recommend to really describe your use case because my
questions about this are still unanswered.

Best regards,
