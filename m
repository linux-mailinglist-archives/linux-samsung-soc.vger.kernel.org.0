You confused me earlier. As I said there will be no clock provider
registered for SCMI CPU/Dev DVFS.
	opp_table->clk = clk_get(dev, NULL);
will always return -EPROBE_DEFER as there is no clock provider for dev.
But this change now propagates that error to caller of dev_pm_opp_add
which means we can't add opp to a device if there are no clock providers.
This breaks for DVFS which don't operate separately with clocks and
regulators.
