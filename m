Did a bit of research, looked at how it's implemented on other
platforms. Before I start reworking it, want to check with you on a
couple of decisions, to avoid unnecessary resubmissions later, if it's
ok:

1. Instead of actually merging PD driver into PMU driver, guess it
might be better to create a new power-controller driver (e.g.
drivers/soc/samsung/exynos-power.c). This is how it's implemented for
the most of platforms, and this way we can neatly separate it from
what we already have in the PMU driver (not really power controller
related things). This way, in device tree we'll have a
power-controller node under PMU node, and this node can be referenced
further as a phandle in power-domains properties of users.

2. After moving PD implementation into a new power-controller driver
(with new compatibility string), the old one (pm_domains.c) should be
probably removed. Is it reasonable, e.g. from point of view of
compatibility with out-of-tree (downstream) dts's? Also, if I remove
the PD driver, probably all existing (upstream) Exynos dts's should be
reworked to use the new power-controller compatibility string?

3. Where to keep offsets for each power domain (inside of PMU register
area). Can be done in dts (a separate child node of power-controller
for each power domain), or in the power-controller driver. I saw both
of those ways for different platforms actually. But I guess offsets
are more like internal details, and should be kept inside the driver,
for each supported SoC.

4. Specifying particular power domain in power-domains property. Guess
the best way would be to have some indexes defined in dt-bindings
header, and use those like this:

        power-domains = <&power_controller EXYNOS850_PD_G3D>;

   Those constants can be also used then in the driver, to keep PD
offsets in the array, etc. Another way would be to use reg offsets,
but indices look better: can provide more flexibility in the driver in
future, e.g. if we'd need to add some more details other that offsets
later.

Please let me know what you think. At the moment I have to switch to
another task temporarily. When I get back to this one, discussing the
above items would help me a great deal.

Thanks!
