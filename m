Thanks for the reviews! As Lee has explained in his replies, the
intent of this series is to provide config flexibility to create a
defconfig that allows us to move out SoC specific drivers in order to
create a generic kernel that can be used across multiple devices with
different SoCs. I'm sorry I added confusion by mentioning
modularization. All of these drivers that I am modifying in this
series can be modularized which is an ongoing effort, but is not
addressed here and I don't believe that modularizing them should be a
requirement before supporting enabling/disabling them.

I will update the series with my patch that refactors the Samsung SoC
drivers menuconfig to make these visible as well.

Thanks,
Will
