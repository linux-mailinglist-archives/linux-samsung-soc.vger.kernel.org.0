But where does the USBCON fit? Is it just a side controller? Why's it needed
in the first place? This is what I don't understand.

Yeah, my point was that it was different from any previous design. Now,
I don't know if it's actually theoretically possible to design it like so. It's
hard to just guess how the hardware is designed without having access
to die shots, documentations or even just schematics.

Let's make it clear now, the changes your request are to document USBCON
in the existing exynos binding, as well as to correct all explanations of how
this block functions, right?
