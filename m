I have created v2 of that fix and it got merged
via Chanwoo's tree, the commit 4fc9a0470d2dc37028
https://lkml.org/lkml/2020/7/10/1048

That commit switched the driver default mode from 'irq driven' to
new devfreq monitoring mechanism. Furthermore, when the driver is
built as a module, you can try to use the 'irq mode', but for this
you would need the DT IRQs description (this $subject tries to remove).

I would like to keep this IRQ mode for experimentation, as I
described in answers to Bartek's questions:
https://lkml.org/lkml/2020/7/14/315

Unfortunately, I am quite busy and won't make any progress before the
LPC.

Regards,
Lukasz
