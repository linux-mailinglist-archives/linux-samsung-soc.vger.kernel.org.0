It doesn't collide with anything on my end yet, because I've been slow to
pick up on the need for changing callsites to add FOLL_LONGTERM. :)

And it looks like that's actually a problem, because:

That's the right direction to go *in general*, but I see that the
pin_user_pages code is still a bit stuck in the past. And this patch
won't actually work, with or without that vma_is_fsdax() check.
Because:

get_vaddr_frames(FOLL_LONGTERM)
    pin_user_pages_locked()
	if (WARN_ON_ONCE(gup_flags & FOLL_LONGTERM))
		return -EINVAL;


So, again, pin_user_pages*() is at least partly behind the times here.
I can jump in and start fixing it up, but it depends on what you and
Oded and others are planning? Note: there is a particular combination of
dax and locking that we have to still avoid, within gup.c. That's
already covered, but needs to continue to be covered when we enable
FOLL_LONGTERM in the remaining pin_user_pages*() calling paths.
