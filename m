I think this is a problem...

I think it is worth having the discussion. There's been some discussions 
about an overlay split with SoMs and baseboards as well. I think that's 
what is driving this addition[1]. I don't think this case is much 
different.

As a different way to combine things compared to .dtsi files, I don't 
care too much how things are structured to the extent that's just 
internal structure and we're moving the combining of files from one 
point in time to another.

My concern here is largely around validation. Can the SoC DTB pass 
validation, and can we still validate the whole thing at build time? To 
start with, it's not great if we have to make the schema allow only an 
SoC compatible without a board compatible. Then suddenly omitting a 
board compatible is always valid. Solving that with an entirely 
different SoC compatible as you have doesn't seem great.

My other concern is whether this is an ABI between the SoC and board 
DTBs? And I don't mean just you, but for anyone wanting to do anything 
remotely similar. An ABI is a problem as we don't really have any way to 
validate each piece separately. (This is already a problem for existing 
overlays.)

Should upstream really care about anything other than MP1? I don't think 
so. Which ones are useful in 1 year, 2 years, 10 years?

It's not clear to me how you map boards to SoC revision? You boot up 
using the SoC DTB and then select the board DTBO based on? This all 
needs to be well defined and general enough any (existing) platform 
could use it. If [1] helps or doesn't work for you I'm interested in 
hearing that.
