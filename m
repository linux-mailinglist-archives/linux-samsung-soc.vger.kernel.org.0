Right. I talked about this at length "after the cut" in my patch. See
above. I wish to relitigate this policy and wish to know more details
about where it is documented, the reasons for decision, and where the
boundary exactly lies between something that's allowed to be a final
compatible and something that's not. I made several arguments above
for why I think the SoC should be allowed as a final compatible, so it
would be great if you could respond to them and tell me where I got it
wrong.

In the commit message I do say: "SoC: an A0 pre-production variant (ID
0x000500) and a B0 variant (ID 0x000510) used in production. The ID is
canonicaly broken up into a 16-bit SoC product ID, a 4-bit major rev,
and a 4-bit minor rev."

...then, I further say "In this patch, put the SoC IDs straight into
the compatible. Though the bootloader doesn't look at the compatible
at the moment, this should be easy to teach the bootloader about."

The idea here is for the bootloader, which can read the ID of the
current SoC, to be able to pick the right device tree from among
multiple. I am certainly not married to putting the SoC ID in the
compatible like this. As I mentioned above, in downstream device trees
the SoC is stored in a custom node and I thought upstream would hate
that. I also considered giving the `soc@0` node a custom compatible
string and adding properties about the SoC ID underneath that and
teaching the bootloader how to find this, and I can switch to this if
you prefer.

If you have an alternate technique for which the bootloader could pick
a device tree based on the current SoC ID or you have specific wording
that you think I should add to the commit message to explain my
current scheme, I'm happy to adjust things.

"google,lga" is the name of the processor. I was under the impression
that the last entry in the top-level compatible string was supposed to
be the SoC compatible string. Certainly this was true in every board
I've worked with and I seem to even recall it being requested by DT
folks. It also seems to match what I see in examples in the kernel
docs [1].

At the moment, the fact that the SoC name is part of the top-level
compatible is used in the Linux driver
"drivers/cpufreq/cpufreq-dt-platdev.c" to implement its blocklist. The
extensive list of compatible strings there shows how prevalent this
concept is.

I seem to recall a previous discussion where Stephen Boyd proposed
that a better place for the SoC compatible string was under the
"soc@0" node. Ah yes, I found at least one [2]  post about it, though
I think there was some earlier discussion too. Do you want me to try
jumping that way?


> What is lga-frankel?

This was an attempt to add a slightly more generic name for the board
in case it was later found to be needed for some reason. I know that,
occasionally, code finds it useful to test a top-level compatible
string to apply a workaround to a specific class of boards. In this
case, if someone needed to detect that they were on a "frankel" board
but didn't care about the specific revision, they could test for this
string.

Alternatively, I could add something like "google,pixel-id-0703xx", or
"google,pixel-id-0703", or something similar which "means"
google,lga-frankel. If you'd prefer this, I'm happy to change it.

I also have no specific need to add the "lga-frankel" compatible
string here other than the fact that it shouldn't really hurt to have
it here, it seems to match the example I pointed to earlier in the
docs [1], and that it could be useful in the future. If you think I
should simply remove it, I can do that. If we later find some need for
it we can add some rules to deal with it then.

"it" being "additionalProperties", I think? I'm not sure I understand,
but let's discuss below in the context of full examples and not diffs.

Trying to understand the above is making my brain hurt. Perhaps I
didn't get enough sleep last night. ...or maybe my brain isn't meant
to directly parse diffs. It's probably easier to just look at
full-blown examples.

Before, we had this:

--

properties:
  ...
  ...
  # Bootloader requires empty ect node to be present
  ect:
    type: object
    additionalProperties: false

required:
  - ect

additionalProperties: true

--

In other words we were _required_ to have an "ect" node with no
properties under it. However, additional properties are allowed in the
root node.

After my patch:

--

properties:
  ..
  ..

allOf:
  # Bootloader requires empty ect node to be present
  - if:
      properties:
        compatible:
          contains:
            const: google,gs101
    then:
      properties:
        ect:
          type: object
          additionalProperties: false

      required:
        - ect

additionalProperties: true

--

In other words, on gs101 we're _required_ to have an "ect" node with
no properties under it. However, additional properties are allowed in
the root node. This seems correct.

The best my brain can parse your request, I think you're asking for this:

--

properties:
  ...
  ...
  ect:
    type: object
    additionalProperties: false

allOf:
  # Bootloader requires empty ect node to be present
  - if:
      properties:
        compatible:
          not:
            contains:
              const: google,gs101
    then:
      properties:
        ect: false
    else:
      required:
      - ect

additionalProperties: true

--

In other words, we still define the "ect" node in the main section and
say that it can't have any extra properties, but we enforce whether
it's required under the "if" statement.

The above has the "downside" compared to my syntax that it bans a node
named "ect" on non-gs101 devices. While this doesn't really hurt, it
also doesn't help. In my mind there's no reason to even think about
(let alone ban) the node "ect" on devices that don't have the gs101
bootloader requirement. Similarly, even though a node named "quack"
would also not really be allowed, we don't have any rule like "quack:
false". :-P

I could also leave the "ect" in the main section and just add the
"required" for "gs101" down below, but then I can't find a use for
your "not:" or "ect: false" lines.

In any case, I'm more than happy to use whatever syntax you prefer for
this, but I'd love it if you could just paste in what you'd like the
syntax to be so I don't need to kill 45 minutes trying to figure it
out, test various hypothesis of what you could mean, and respond. ;-)
