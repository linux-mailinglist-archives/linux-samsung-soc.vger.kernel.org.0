No, that's just as disconnected from the need - we may as well do it
based on the regulator name being an odd number of characters.

I think that's better TBH.

So I think that the specific approach there is overly heavyweight and
restrictive but I do see the general use case here for something per
regulator providing we can avoid breaking anything that does actually
need to change the regulator state (eg, raising the voltage for
cpufreq).  Previously to the past week I'd only really heard about it
causing problems in the context of displays left on by the bootloader
glitching during boot but this is a concrete use case and we already
have the infrastructure to track dependencies at the device model level
if we use it well. =20

OTOH if you have a coupler already that needs to be doing stuff all the
time at runtime it may be easier to just put this in the coupler,
especially I think in this case where the lack of the devfreq driver
wouldn't mean that the hardware being controlled wasn't being used at
all.  The coupler would end up backstopping a missing cpufreq or devfreq
driver.
