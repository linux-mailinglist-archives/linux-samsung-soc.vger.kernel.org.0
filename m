The current policy (since before 2013) is that newer kernels,
implementing new bindings, do not break with old existing dtbs.

Old existing kernels are not required to work with new dtbs.

See Documentation/devicetree/bindings/ABI.rst

We can choose to change the rules, so I'm not saying that the
discussion should not occur.  I'm just pointing out the
current policy.

I think that ABI.rst does not state "Old existing kernels are
not required to work with new dtbs" clearly enough, and
should be updated to do so.

I also think it would be good to explicitly say that care
should be taken with new bindings to not break existing
kernels, if reasonably possible.
